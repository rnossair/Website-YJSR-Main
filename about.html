In high school, I discovered my love & niche for studying the biological and medical sciences through a regional sports medicine program offered at my school. In addition to my high school diploma, I hold a sports medicine career pathway certificate from the North Orange County Regional Occupational Program. In the career pathway, I received a foundational education in human anatomy and physiology while learning how to prevent sports injuries and illnesses, provide emergency care, examination, clinical diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and rehabilitation of injuries & medical conditions. Through the pathway, I also completed a medical innovation internship with UCI & CHOC hospital in which I along with a group of students addressed medical noncompliance in pediatric, and epileptic patients among other unmet clinical needs. This helped solidify my passion and desire to serve humanity through the science of medicine and medical education. In the future, I aspire to earn a doctoral degree, teach at the undergraduate level, and offer my services in the public health sector to help advance global health and address the systemic issues in healthcare involving inequality and discrimination.</p>`

                        <!-- Main Content/ Article Body -->
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As climate change worsens across the globe, industries have attempted to find efficient ways to reduce their footprint. It is a common aim among such industries to reach a net zero contribution of carbon emissions, which may seem impossible. <br><br>

Within the tech industry, this task appears even more challenging, considering technology and engineering involve processes that are difficult to carry out without the usage of these harmful materials. Specifically, Software Development accounts for approximately 4% of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to that of the ENTIRE aviation industry. With energy consumption levels from these companies expected to triple by 2030, the challenge of reducing carbon emissions puts pressure on those in charge.<br><br>

To combat this, Green Coding has been discovered as a mechanism for reducing the energy output of programming and programs. However, this approach poses a question: Does it work? 
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Exploration</h2>
                        <p>Green Coding is an efficient and sustainable energy reduction strategy that aims to create computer algorithms that consume minimal energy. It enables software programmers and developers to create code that consumes minimal energy.<br><br>

Since lines of code are parsed, the device used to process the code helps enhance carbon emissions. When a device processes more code at a given time, a higher level of carbon emissions occurs. <br><br>

Additionally, 90% of software development projects employ open-source code (code that can be used for a variety of purposes; it is not tailored for specific uses and applications), which contains a multitude of general code accompanied by general code snippets. This code includes redundant sections, using more processing power and giving rise to unnecessary carbon emissions.
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How It Works</h2>
                        <p>Instead of creating new programming methods that could delay the progress of the tech industry,  green coding encourages engineers to consider writing and designing code that prioritizes energy efficiency while keeping functionality in mind. <br><br>

This practice promotes lean coding, which reduces the amount of processing required for the same, or even better, quality and result. For instance, web developers can use high-quality media with smaller files to complete their projects. Organisations can reduce the use of large files in this manner, allowing users minimal loading time and maximum product efficiency.<br><br>

Programmers should stray from open source code, making their codespecific, and adhering to older standards of programming, which prioritized short, succinct code. In this manner, the redundancies in code are eliminated, thus reducing the energy that would have been applied to run redundant code snippets. <br><br>

Simple changes in programming habits, such as eliminating unnecessary calculations, using energy-efficient libraries and frameworks, employing energy-efficient emulators in the debugging process, and reusing code snippets for similar operations, can all contribute to energy efficiency.  
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Additional Methods</h2>
                        <p>Alongside improving the way in which code is carried out, additional office reduction habits include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Powering off IT equipment not in use</li>
                            <li>Strategically scheduling computer use, ensuring intervals for powering off devices.</li>
                            <li>Using energy-efficient computers and displays in the workplace</li>
                            <li>Employing automated power management to ensure devices aren’t left powered on during periods of inactivity</li>
                            <li>Carrying out proper electronic waste disposal, according to federal, state, or local regulations </li>
                            <li>Investing in alternative energy opportunities, like wind and hydroelectric power</li>
                            <li>Support/Facilitating remote and hybrid work, reducing emissions created through commuting and work equipment </li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>To maximise climate consciousness, consider programming languages with maximum energy efficiency::</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elixir</li>
                            <li>Haskell</li>
                            <li>C</li>
                            <li>Rust</li>
                            <li>C++</li>
                            <li>Ada</li>
                            <li>Java</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NB - Faster programming languages are not always the most energy efficient. While Java ranks well in both energy efficiency and speed, Python, Perl, Ruby, etc., are among the least efficient programming languages.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Environmental Benefits</h2>
                        <p>Based on the information above, green coding is presumed to have an outstanding impact on the environment. If this method is adopted by a majority of tech companies, we can expect to see a drastic reduction in emissions and the footprint of the tech industry. Energy efficiency guarantees a brighter future for carbon emissions;; although it will take a while to have a prevalent impact on our environment, it is certainly a stepping stone towards the elimination of emissions.  </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Business Benefits</h2>
                        <p>In addition to environmental benefits, tech businesses that implement green coding are set to reap significant rewards. To begin with, using fewer results in spending less, which is of great benefit to companies. While engaging in environmental sustainability, businesses also contribute to their economic sustainability. 
<br><br>
Green coding can also accelerate progress toward a company’s sustainability goals, moving many tech companies to their net-zero emission or emission reduction goals<br><br>

Higher earnings may also be on the table for companies implementing such practices, i.e. CEOs that have implemented sustainability and digital transformation initiatives, such as green coding, reported a higher average operating margin than their peers, according to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/c-suite-study/ceo">IBM 2022 CEO Study.</a><br><br>
	
Moreover, green coding will facilitate the strengthening of relationships with customers and business partners and open up new business opportunities by positioning itself as a responsible and innovative company,
Finally, amidst the climate crisis, taking the initiative to reduce a company’s footprint will improve a company’s image, which can lead to higher brand awareness and loyalty.
</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Based on the above analysis, green coding can be considered efficient, with no drawbacks hindering its progress or effectiveness. Green coding is not only good for the environment but can also help save businesses money in the long run. For carbon emissions from the tech industry to see a decline, instead of the predicted incline, green coding should implemented. It is an easy practice to implement, and instead of costing industries money, it can actually generate additional revenue for them. </p>

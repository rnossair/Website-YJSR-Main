                        <p>Many of us are familiar with the concept of how delicate butterflies and their wings are. If you have ever seen a butterfly up close, it is not unusual to see how thin and large their wings can be. Instead of having direct flight paths, these creatures often have irregular flight patterns. This can be seen as a side effect of their delicate bodyweight along with their larger, seemingly unsupported wings. However, although butterflies may seem to be accessible, it is actually quite difficult to catch one, even one at rest. A new research conducted by ecologists at Lund University in Sweden proves and dictates what role physics plays in a butterfly’s quick getaway from potential predators.</p>
                        <p>Ecologists Christoffer Johansson and Per Henningsson from Lund University, are known for researching the evolution of animal flight. These two decided to take past theories about butterflies using a “wing clap” to form the air, which helps propel the butterflies forward swiftly, and test how true the theory is. This notion is also commonly known in physics as jet propulsion. Sir Isaac Newton's third law of motion states that "for every force acting on a body, there is an opposite and equal reaction”.  Jet propulsion is a practical application of this law. For instance, the "body" of an aircraft's propulsion system is atmospheric air that is accelerated as it travels through the engine, which is similar to theories about the butterflies using wing claps and air to help accelerate.</p>
                        <p>Despite decades-old research and hypotheses regarding this study, no researcher had yet conducted an experiment to prove its existence, until Johansson and Hennningsson stepped up. <br>The ecologists began the experiment in a meadow near their lab, starting off with six butterflies of the same species and diet to ensure consistent and unbiased results. To help assess their flight pattern more closely and in singularity, the scientists placed one butterfly at a time inside a wind tunnel.  “Wind tunnels use fans to move air at specific speeds. When an object is placed in the tunnel, the air has to flow around it. This lets researchers test how objects move through the air. “Smoke” made of tiny harmless droplets of oil is often added so researchers can observe precisely how air flows around something. This shows how aerodynamic the object is. (Aerodynamics refers to how air moves around solid objects.)”  (Science News for Students).</p>
                        <p>In the experiment, the fans inside the wind tunnel worked at a speed just enough to keep the layer of smoke continuous and even around the space. High-speed lenses set around the feeding station documented the butterfly's motion and spoke as it took off. “For each trial, the researchers placed a butterfly at a feeding station in the middle of the tunnel. They began recording when the butterfly took flight on its own.” (Science News for Students). This process helped create 3-D images of the air movement when the insect flapped its wings, which greatly assisted in analyzing the flight habits more clearly. <br>At the end of the study, a total of twenty-five butterfly take-offs were observed, in which the ecologists concluded that “up to three wingbeats [were done] after takeoff. The butterflies proved more likely to clap their wings together during the first few wingbeats than later in flight” (Science News for Students).</p>
                        <p>Johansson and Henningsson also discovered a new understanding of what role jet propulsion plays in the insect’s quick getaway from predators and potential threats. In simple words, the clap function does generate a jet of air propulsion. To elaborate, when water or air spins around a focal point, a vortex occurs. This is usually seen in examples such as whirlpools and tornadoes. In the scientist's study, the 3-D pictures that were captured revealed that there was “air swirling in a vortex as [the butterfly’s] wings moved”.  Furthermore, the wing’s downstroke motion helped create a force of air that pushed the butterfly up, and when “the wings moved up to clap, they made an air pocket. This pocket created a strong jet of air that shot out between the wings behind the butterfly. That jet-propelled the insect forward” (Science News for Students). This analysis was a clear example of jet propulsion being utilized to create swift and efficient flight for the butterfly.</p>
                        <p>The ecologists decided to construct simple butterfly wing models to test what role flexibility played in improving the butterfly’s jet propulsion. Their set of flexible wing models created one vortex ring compared to the two vortex rings created by a more rigid set of wings. By demonstrating this, they were also able to conclude how thinner and more flexible wings create a much stronger jet compared to the less efficient model.</p>
                        <p>This study was reflected on by many other well-known scientists, who dictated what importance this research can have on the science world in the future. For instance, “‘The study is exciting,” says Ayodeji Bode-Oke. He is a researcher at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He has studied the mechanics of how insects move, though he was not part of the new work. This is the first study to measure the jet created by butterfly wings, he notes. That means “we have a better understanding of how butterflies fly,” Bode-Oke says. As an aerospace and mechanical engineer, he is particularly interested in how the study might inform designs for small flying vehicles, such as flapping drones”.  (Science News for Students) <br>To conclude, this experiment done by Johansson and Henningsson has created a better understanding of jet propulsion mechanics in delicate wings, while opening up more concepts for scientists to explore in the future. This study may not have been revolutionary on a larger scale, but it will play a key role in assisting the design of new wing models in aerodynamic vehicles, as Ayodeji Bode-Oke also stated. In the long term, this information can definitely be more progressive and help impact the mechanics of futuristic devices. Lastly, this event does have an impact on people’s and scientists’ thinking, as they now have a better understanding of this new concept, as well as research to back it up.</p>

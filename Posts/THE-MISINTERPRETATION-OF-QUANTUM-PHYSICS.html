                        <p>As one of the most famous thought experiments attributed to quantum physics, Schrödinger’s Cat is still frequently misinterpreted. Without prior knowledge of this field of subatomic behavior, the thought experiment suggests that the simultaneous existence of death and life (known in scientific terms as “superposition”) is a fundamental aspect of quantum physics. Essentially, this is the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, in which a subatomic particle assumes every possible position at once; upon observation, the wave function collapses, and the particle assumes only one position. Erwin Schrödinger, however, disagreed with this interpretation, for it contradicted what we understood as natural. After all, when applying the Copenhagen interpretation to tangible subjects, a state of superposition cannot exist. In this loose presentation of quantum physics and some of the still-present gaps in our knowledge, we dive deeper into why Schrödinger disagreed with the Copenhagen interpretation and what role his thought experiment played in this branch of physics.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">THE FOUNDATION: QUANTUM PHYSICS</h2>
                        <p>Essentially a scientific theory, quantum physics attempts to explain the behavior of subatomic particles such as atoms, protons, electrons, and photons through numerous interpretations. The most common one is the widely-taught and embraced Copenhagen interpretation, originating from physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg in 1920. In an effort to make sense of their observations of particles that were not in accordance with classical physics, their interpretation details the existence of a quantum particle in every possible state until an observation is made and the wave function collapses into the state which we had observed. This phenomenon is most evident in the double-slit experiment, where three walls are set up to reveal two slits between them with a larger wall behind them. A machine placed on the other end of the three walls first projects subatomic particles constantly and then individually. As each particle made contact with the larger wall, an interference pattern appeared, suggesting that these particles actually behaved like waves. After all, it would have produced two lines on the larger wall due to two available slits instead of four. This was a major contradiction to the grounded belief that photons, electrons, and such were particles.</p>
                        <p>But what was even more appalling was the change in its wave properties when an observer was present. Rather than forming an interference pattern as before, the surveillanced quantum entity demonstrated the properties of a particle, going through only one slit or the other–never both at the same time. This revolutionary phenomenon was named the wave-particle duality. From this discovery, a myriad of other properties for subatomic particles emerged: superposition, entanglement, and Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle.</p>
                        <p>It is perhaps easier to understand superposition and entanglement than Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, where superposition describes a particle with multiple states all at once, while entanglement describes two or more particles being coupled in a way that binds them together. Thus, as one particle is measured, the other particle’s properties are automatically revealed no matter how far they may be apart from each other (though their properties are opposite of each other: if the measured particle is found spinning clockwise, the other entangled particle will be spinning counterclockwise). Here was another challenge to established science: entanglement fundamentally contradicted classical physics and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity as information traveled from one point to another faster than the speed of light. Einstein, of course, found this property and its concept of instantaneous information implausible and dismissed it even as he had laid most of the foundation for quantum physics through his discoveries. Rather, he believed that information was already embedded in particles long before they became entangled, and that this was what allowed entanglement to function. Later, he would be scientifically proven wrong about his theory of entanglement.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is certainly harder to understand. It is essentially a trade-off between knowing the position of a particle in its state of a wave but nothing about its momentum, or knowing its exact momentum but nothing about its position. The momentum of such a particle is calculated by measuring the wavelength (the distance between two crests or highest humps) of the wave function, while the position is calculated by squaring the amplitude of the wave function. In any case, even when we calculate the particle's location, we are merely computing a probability distribution of where the particle could be rather than an exact position. A wave function that has been altered to find a particle's position would have the highest points representing where the particle would be most likely to be found, while the lowest points representing where it would be least likely to be found. Heights at an in-between represent in-between percentages of a most likely and least likely chance of a particle appearing at that position. In short, to have a definite momentum, a wave function must have more than one crest, but this possession of more than one crest makes measuring the precise position of a quantum particle impossible as we can only measure its probability of appearance. Thus, momentum and position can never be simultaneously measured. However, science today has even gone as far as to suggest that the inability to measure both at the same time comes from both simply not existing at the same time.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">THE MISUNDERSTOOD: SCHRODINGER’S CAT</h2>
                        <p>When the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics fell into the awareness of physicist Erwin Schrödinger, the characteristics of it--especially its interpretation of superposition--disturbed him. Thus, Schrödinger devised a thought experiment involving a cat locked inside a metal box with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter (a device used to detect radiation, which is what is released if the radioactive atom decays), a hammer, and a glass container with poison inside. Within an hour, if the atom decays then the Geiger counter will trigger the hammer and break the glass container, releasing the poison inside and killing the cat. On the other hand, if the atom does not decay then the Geiger counter does not trigger the hammer and the cat lives. In this scenario, the atom, Geiger counter, hammer, glass container, and cat are entangled.</p>
                        <p>When the Copenhagen interpretation is applied to this thought experiment, it explains that the cat is in a superposition of being both dead and alive, and it is only when an observer opens the lid of the box that this superposition state collapses into one.</p>
                        <p>While Schrödinger's thought experiment may seem to support Copenhagen's interpretation of superposition on the surface, he had, in fact, intended to demonstrate the ridiculousness of misinterpreting quantum physics. After all, a cat cannot be physically alive and dead at the same time--it was either dead or alive at any certain time and this would be revealed to an observer when they removed the lid. Even then, before the lid was removed, the cat was still either dead or alive.</p>
                        <p>In the end, there is just no way something can both be in one state and another at the same time. As a result, Schrödinger's actual point has often been lost in interpretation.</p>

                        <p>Have you ever sat in class trying to focus on the task at hand, but there seems to be some sort of fog settled over your brain and nothing is clicking? Do you relate to the feeling of your brain “having too many tabs open,” causing you distraction and lack of focus? This sense of inability to concentrate and “brain fog” have driven many people, mostly children and young adults, to consult with their doctors and get diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder, or ADHD. The first line of defense employed by doctors is prescribing a psycho stimulant, the most popular of which is Adderall. The growing numbers of prescriptions as well as huge amounts of non-prescribed use has had both its benefits and drawbacks. Students are reportedly able to concentrate better, but at what cost?</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How does Adderall Work?</h2>
                        <p>Adderall mainly functions by tinkering with the neurochemicals in your brain, most importantly, dopamine and norepinephrine. Dopamine is known as the “happy chemical” and is linked to your brain’s reward system. Many people who struggle with ADHD have a dysfunctional reward system in their brain, and don’t get the usual motivational good feelings when accomplishing tasks. So, when someone is prescribed Adderall, their dopamine levels rise, therefore motivating them to be more productive. Norepinephrine, on the other hand, is known as the “stress chemical”. It is linked to the attention and response parts of our brains that keep us alert [1]. The raised levels of norepinephrine increases blood flow and allows those with ADHD to be more focused on the tasks they need to accomplish.</p>
                        <p>Many onlookers, mostly parents, are very concerned about the scientific name of Adderall, dextroamphetamine-amphetamine. The suffix “amphetamine” looks familiar to methamphetamine, a famously addictive and dangerous drug. While they do have similar chemical structures, and are both classified as a stimulant, their potency and the way that they are ingested into the body make for a very different experience. Adderall is taken in a pill form, meaning that the time for the drug to take effect and enter the bloodstream is about 30 minutes to an hour. Methamphetamine, on the other hand, is often snorted or injected, causing the drug to have almost immediate effect. This immediacy results in an instantaneous rush of good feelings (dopamine and norepinephrine) is what causes higher addiction and abuse rates, as well as the increased potency.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What’s the Problem?</h2>
                        <p>For those really struggling with ADHD, Adderall can be a lifesaver. It allows them to focus better in school or at work, and just function more efficiently in their day-to-day lives. The issue is, people who are not diagnosed with ADHD wanted some of this increased focus for themselves, too. Students, especially high school and onward, have resorted to using Adderall illicitly in order to study more effectively or do better on tests. In 2020, it is estimated that over five million people abused prescription stimulants, and this misuse is highest among individuals 18 to 25 years old [2].</p>
                        <p>This is a huge concern among medical professionals because of the side effects of misuse, many of which are unknown to non-prescribed users. The side effects of misuse can include heart attacks, high blood pressure, stroke, liver damage, kidney damage, seizures, psychosis, and mental health issues (including depression and anxiety). For the average prescribed user, their doctor would likely tell them exactly the dosage they should take to avoid these risks, but those that are receiving them illicitly do not know the recommended dosage.</p>
                        <p>Medical experts suggest that non-prescribed users look elsewhere for that dopamine or norepinephrine high. Students can take short breaks from studying to energize themselves, exercise, or stick to the most obvious solution— coffee. Avoiding severe health and addiction risks are always the number one priority, grades and test scores can wait.</p>

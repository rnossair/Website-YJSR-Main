                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction to Bipolar Disorder</h2>
                        <p>Bipolar disorder, also called manic depression, is a psychiatric illness that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. Patients may experience “up” behavior (manic episodes), or very “down” behavior (depressive episodes). There are three types of this disorder, Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Cyclothymic, which differentiate based on the length and extent of each of their episodes and symptoms. Manic episode symptoms that have been diagnosed for this disorder have been characterized as paranoia, over-excitement, aggression, and high energy while depressive episode symptoms include low energy, anxiety, hopelessness, or loss of interest. This disorder is usually diagnosed in young adults or even teen years and requires lifelong need for treatment. These types of conditions can be caused by many different circumstances, including environmental (trauma, injuries, toxins) and genetic factors.</p>
                        
                        <p>Primary medication treatments for bipolar disorder include mood stabilizers (lithium, valproic acid, etc) or antidepressants. Clearly, there is a wide range of drug treatments available. But often, choosing the right medication for each patient is a struggle, and can span many years. Since these disorders are found to be partially caused by genetic factors, new research aims to shorten this process by matching drug treatments to individual patients, based on their genetic profile (types of genes expressed in the body). In other words, a patient’s genes play a very significant part in whether or not they develop certain disorders. And this can help with deciding what medication would work best for certain people with certain genes. For example, patients with a certain ‘risk’ gene identified within them can be treated with different medication than another patient with a completely different genetic profile. This way, the process of treatment is much more efficient and deliberately done than guesswork.</p>
                                                
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Factors influencing risk for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
                        <p>All genes go through a process of gene expression, a term used to explain the process of the gene turning on/off in a cell and the production of a protein. This is done through the processes of transcription and translation. In this mechanism, this gene’s information gets passed to a nucleic acid molecule, mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid). A different type of RNA called transfer (tRNA) along with the help of ribosomes, translates and codes for the amino acids that make up the protein.</p>
                        
                        <img src="/assets/others/Genetic-Basis-of-Behavior-in-Bipolar-Disorder-fig-1.png" class="illus-img">
                        
                        <p><i>Polymorphisms</i> are defined as one of two or more variants of a particular DNA sequence. In other words, it is described as a change of a single nucleotide in the sequence of nucleotides shown above (TACC…). This code will then be read differently from the tRNA and produce a different amino acid, or even protein. This change can seem similar to a mutation, however non-harmful. An example is phenotypical traits, such as hair, eye, or skin color.</p>
                        
                        <p><i>Neurotransmitters</i> are chemical messengers in the body that process electrical signals from the brain and transmit messages between neurons. 3 important neurotransmitters, or catecholamines, that have been proven to be implicated with the illness are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These are also known as the ‘pleasure’ emotions. These neurotransmitters are very crucial because if they have any sort of imbalance or alteration, the communication between the brain and body is disrupted and can cause many behavioral dysfunctions such as depression and severe mood swings, widely observed in Bipolar. This is in correlation to our attention to the genetic aspect behind this illness because of how the function/activity of neurotransmitters is highly dependent on the gene expression of these genes.</p>
                        
                        <p>This research paper will talk about 3 significant genes that have been identified in patients with Bipolar disorder and will describe each gene’s or genetic variation’s individual association between the neurotransmitter it impacts, and the effect on the behavioral phenotypes (symptoms) in humans. These will include <i>DAOA</i>, <i>COMT</i>, and <i>DISC1</i>.</p>
                                                
                        <h2 class="section-heading">DAOA</h2>
                        <p>DAOA Stands for the D-amino acid oxidase activator gene. This gene is located on chromosome 13q34. This represents that it is located on the longer leg of the 13th chromosome in position 34. It is enriched and expressed highly in various parts of the central nervous system (CNS), including the amygdala, caudate nucleus, spinal cord, and testis. This gene codes for a protein (D-amino acid oxidase activator) through the process of gene expression mentioned above, which then activates/increases the activity of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO).</p>
                        
                        <img src="/assets/others/Genetic-Basis-of-Behavior-in-Bipolar-Disorder-fig-2.png" class="illus-img">
                        <p class="img-cap">The reaction of oxidative deamination of D-amino acids: Oxidation of D-amino acids is getting reduced until it becomes a catecholamine.</p>
                        
                        <p> D-serine is a neurotransmitter that is important because it is bound with a neurotransmitter receptor called N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). NMDA is found to be directly related to the dopamine system and they form new synapses, which is a form of communication from neurons in the brain to neurons in the rest of our body, playing an important role in memory and learning. Thus, when this DAO enzyme regulates the breakdown of D-serine, it also causes the hypofunction, or decreased function, of NMDA receptors. This is found to be associated with decreases in memory and learning impairments in the individual and can cause behaviors such as hallucinations, paranoid delusions, confusion, difficulty concentrating, agitation, alterations in mood, nightmares, catatonia, ataxia, anesthesia, and learning and memory deficits. These behavioral characteristics have been shown throughout many disorders, including bipolar disorder. An SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism in the gene DAOA popular in patients with Bipolar called <i>rs1935058</i> according to several research studies, has been found to increase the risk of this disease as well.</p>
                                                
                        <h2 class="section-heading">COMT</h2>
                        <p>	Another crucial gene involved with developing relative symptomatic behaviors is COMT. COMT Stands for the Catechol-O-methyl-transferase gene. This gene is located on chromosome 22q11.2, which represents the longer leg of chromosome 22 in position 11.2. This gene is expressed mostly in the liver, kidneys, and blood and MB-COMT (membrane-bound COMT) is found mostly in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortical areas of the brain. This gene essentially codes for an enzyme called Catechol-O-methyl-transferase. This enzyme then catalyzes or causes the reaction for the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to catecholamines. This reaction results in catabolization/causes the degradation of catecholamines. This is significant because catecholamines are neurotransmitters that generally are responsible for mediating a variety of central nervous system functions (motor control, cognition, emotion, memory processing, and endocrine modulation).</p>
                        
                        <img src="/assets/others/Genetic-Basis-of-Behavior-in-Bipolar-Disorder-fig-3.png" class="illus-img">
                        
                        <p>As shown above, this degradation/breakdown also makes them responsible for disturbing the regulation of catecholamines such as dopamine and epinephrine (adrenaline) found in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. Dopamine and epinephrine are two neurotransmitters that allow the communication of signals between neurons responsible for emotion, pleasure and reward-seeking, addiction, and perception. In the end, the fluctuation of these neurotransmitter levels will prove to have significantly caused behavioral changes such as major aggression, anxiety, addiction, etc. Some studies conducted for mice have been subjected to evidence that extremely increased levels of COMT do cause impulsive and compulsive behavior and slower response learning. Another animal model showed that male mice lacking one copy of the COMT gene showed extra hostility and aggression towards each other. Studies also show SNP <i>rs165599</i> in the COMT gene to have a significant association with Bipolar 1 and influence prefrontal aspects of verbal memory in bipolar patients.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">DISC-1</h2>
                        
                        <p>The gene called DISC-1, which stands for Disturbed-in-Schizophrenia, is located on chromosome 1q14.1, standing for the longer leg of chromosome 1 in position 14.1. DISC1 is expressed in several brain regions, including the olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, and brainstem. This gene codes for a protein called DISC-1 Scaffold protein, which has a coiled-up motif (region of the protein) located in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and mitochondria that is easy to identify the protein with. This protein is responsible for regulating neural development and brain maturation such as neuronal proliferation, differentiation, migration, cAMP signaling, cytoskeletal modulation, and translational regulation via various signaling pathways. It also interacts and involves with proteins in the dopamine system.  This gene is disrupted by a balanced chromosomal translocation (where a chromosome breaks off and attaches to another chromosome and causes a genetic change) that correlates with Schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.</p>
                        
                        <img src="/assets/others/Genetic-Basis-of-Behavior-in-Bipolar-Disorder-fig-4.png" class="illus-img">
                        
                        <p>This translocation can cause flaws in chromosomes and cause dopamine impairments. Because of this, the body loses a lot of its motor control and ability to fine-tune movements. This can result in tremors, trouble moving, and fatigue, commonly prevalent in many many mental illnesses, including Bipolar.</p>
                        
                        <p>Overall, this paper has thoroughly explained how genetic dysfunction can have an impact on the behavioral outcome of Bipolar Disorder. In the process, the significance of the DAOA, COMT, and DISC-1 genes and their genetic variations were explained.  So why exactly is it important to research the genes relevant to these disorders? This is because through this research, we can finally understand how these causative genetic factors and their functions have such a huge impact on our bodily mechanisms that strike a spread in disease and dysfunction. Hence, this allows us to focus on personalized medicines that target those genetic factors and help in managing and treating the resulting symptoms of these complex neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>

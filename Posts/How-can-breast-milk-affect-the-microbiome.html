                        <p>The role of the microbiome is often underestimated in the body. Inside the intestines lie millions of bacterial, viral  microorganisms similar to a bustling city on a weekday morning. Within healthy microbiomes, a larger number of healthy microorganisms and a smaller number of pathogenic microorganisms coexist peacefully.</p>
                        <p>However where microbiota is disrupted in the microbiome due to certain diets and illnesses, this can lead to gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and wider manifestations of diseases such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes.</p>
                        <p>The role of the microbiome extends out of the intestines. For example, the Gut brain axis, a concept which has intrigued scientists for many years, is a communication system that offers the intestinal microbiota a route to access the brain. It also works the opposite way, therefore allowing the brain to control gastrointestinal functions such as peristalsis.</p>
                        <p>Recent studies have linked microbiota with anxiety, and even more recently with autism. Microbiota can also influence ENS activity by producing neurotransmitters such as GABA(Gamma-aminobutyric acid) and Serotonin.</p>
                        <p>The colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract with microbiota happens immediately after birth. Vaginally delivered infants have a high abundance of Lactobacillus, while C-section infants have a low abundance of Bacteroides.</p>
                        <p>This is demonstrated by a study showing that the mode of delivery influences the baby's microbiota. The microbiota of vaginally delivered infants  has a 72% resemblance to the mother’s microbiome, whereas in babies delivered by C -section the percentage is only 41%.</p>
                        <p>Over the first year of development,  this is when the microbiome develops significantly. By 2.5 years of development, the microbiota hugely resembles the adult microbiota.</p>
                        <p>The growth of certain microbiota in the infant  is significantly influenced by the mother. Breast milk contributes to the development of the infant's microbiota.Breast milk  consists of a variety of nutrients which play a large role in shaping the infant gut microbiome.</p>
                        <p>For instance, bacteria in the breast milk affect commensal bacteria during the first stage of life. Most human milk bacteria are involved in either lactate production or lactate utilisation. This leads to the establishment of balanced metabolic activities in the gut, which prevents lactase accumulation related disorders.</p>
                        <p>With its maximum potential only recently discovered, IgG antibodies play a crucial role in shaping the microbiome. The presence of IgG antibodies in breast milk allows infant deficiencies to be counteracted by opsonization - This is a process which uses opsonins to tag foreign pathogens so that phagocytes can destroy them.</p>
                        <p>Without an opsonin, the negatively charged walls of the pathogen and phagocyte repel each other. This means the pathogen will not be destroyed and will continue to replicate in the body.</p>
                        <p>Secretory igA antibodies can also shape the microbiome. These antibodies have the ability to prevent pathogens from gaining access to the epithelium - an ability known as ‘immune exclusion’. This is how SiGAs block microbes from attaching and invading  epithelial cells. For example, SiGAs prevent Clostridium Difficile toxin from binding to brush border membrane receptors.</p>
                        <p>Human milk also contains crucial hormones which retain their biological activity in the gut. This is due to the post-transcriptional modification in the mammary gland before secretion into human milk.</p>
                        <p>As a result, this increases their resistance to digestion. A study has shown a positive association between breast milk insulin and breast milk leptin in increasing microbial diversity.</p>
                        <p>Insulin and leptin are responsible for developing a barrier against intestine inflammation, due to their association with bacterial function. This is very beneficial as by promoting a strong intestinal barrier earlier on in the child’s life: this may protect children from low-grade inflammation.</p>
                        <p>The role of lactoferrin has been more widely explored during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a substance which binds to iron and is transferred via a variety of receptors into cells , bile and serum. Lactoferrin has specialist properties: it is antibiotic, anti-carcinogenic, and antifungal. It also has an ability to limit the availability of iron to microbes.</p>
                        <p>In relation to Covid-19, LF uses Heparan Sulphate Proteoglycans on cell surfaces to allow themselves to enter. Corona viruses bind to the host cell by attaching to HSPGs, utilising them as docking sites on the host cell surface.</p>
                        <p>Lactoferirn interferes with receptors used by coronaviruses, which contributes to the prevention of COVID infections. Furthermore, Lactoferrins increases the activity of natural killer cells and causes the aggregation of neutrophils , which again can be used as a defence mechanism against Coronavirus.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, many components in breast milk bring benefits to the infant intestinal  microbiome as well as the immune system. In many studies it has been proven that breastfed babies have greater levels of beneficial gut bacteria and healthier growth patterns than babies who are not breastfed.</p>
                        <p>Hence this shows that breast milk plays a promising role in shaping neonatal gut microbiota composition which can then prevent future allergies and diseases.</p>

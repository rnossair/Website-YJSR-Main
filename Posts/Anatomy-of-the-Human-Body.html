                        <p>There are a total of twelve  (12) systems in the body.  Without a doubt, it is amazing how our body is made, built, and works! In this article, I will first be stating the twelve different systems and focus on the skeletal system.</p>
                        
                        <p>The twelve (12) systems being:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The skeletal system</li>
                            <li>The muscular system</li>
                            <li>The nervous system</li>
                            <li>The automatic nervous system</li>
                            <li>The circulatory system</li>
                            <li>The lymphatic/immune system</li>
                            <li>The digestive system</li>
                            <li>The respiratory system</li>
                            <li>The urinary system</li>
                            <li>The male reproductive system</li>
                            <li>The female reproductive system</li>
                            <li>The endocrine system</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What does the skeletal system compromise?</h2>
                        <p>“The skeletal system is the framework/ outline of the body and is usually divided into two (2) parts. The axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton consists of the skull, spine, ribs, and the sternum. The appendicular skeleton consists of the upper and lower limbs.”</p>
                        
                        <h4>The axial system:</h4>
                        <p>As mentioned previously, “the axial system comprises the skull, vertebral column, rib cage, and sternum.” The lower section of the skull gives shape to the face and serves as a protective shell for the brain and the sensory organs. The atlas, the first vertebra of the spine, links the base of the skull; “the articulation of the two bones nodding. Opening in the skull accommodates the eyes, nose, ears, and the mouth.” Sutures are distinctive joints that are found on the bones of the skull- that join and are tightly fixed together by fibrous connective tissue.</p>
                        
                        <p>The spine, also known as the vertebral column, is the building of bone, called vertebrae. “Each vertebrae are unconnected by a cushioning pad of fibrocartilage, called the intervertebral disk.” While each vertebra has very limited movement on its own, the vertebra as a whole- form a highly dynamic unit. When necessary, the vertebrae becomes a compact unit, securely attached by the back muscles- enabling for movements such as lifting. The ribs of the thoracic cage connect to the vertebrae at the back to enclose the heart and lungs. “true ribs” which are the first seven (7) ribs are attached to the sternum at the front. The false ribs, the next three (3) ribs, are connected to one another, and are then attached to the last true rib. The remaining two, which are called floating ribs, do not have the function of extending to the front.</p>
                        
                        <h4>The appendicular skeleton:</h4>
                        <p>As mentioned previously, the appendicular skeleton contains lower and upper limbs. But specifically, it consists of the limb bones of the arms and legs, and the girdles that attach them to the axial skeleton, the shoulder girdle and the pelvic girdle, comprising the axial skeleton. Long bones are found in the arm (humerus, radius, and ulna) and leg (femur, tibia, and fibula).  The bones of the hand and feet have a similar structure, consisting of fourteen bones in the fingers and toes, eight bones in the wrist, seven bones in the ankle, five bones in the palm and soles of the feet.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Joints:</h4>
                        <p>There are six types of joints:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Hinge</li>
                            <li>Ball-and-socket</li>
                            <li>Pivot</li>
                            <li>Gliding</li>
                            <li>Saddle</li>
                            <li>Ellipsoidal joints</li>
                        </ol>
                        
                        <p> Starting with hinge joints- they only move in one plane. They allow flexion (bending) and extension (straightening) of the elbow, knee, hand, feet, interphalangeal, and tibiotalar joints of the ankle.</p>
                        
                        <p>Next is the ball-and-socket joints. They offer the greatest range of movement. Their shape is similar to a cup-like socket. Their job is to guard the ball-shaped end of another bone.</p>
                        
                        <p>Coming third, we have the pivot joints. They offer rotational movement. Their job is “the articulation between the first and second cervical vertebrae, the atlas and axis.</p>
                        
                        <p>Fourth, we have gliding joints. Some locations of gliding joints are your wrists and ankles. Gliding joints are located between the surfaces of two flat bones  that are held together by ligaments. Between joints, there is something called synovial fluid (also known as joint fluid). This fluid permits the bones of the gliding joint to slide across each other in a restricted movement. In general, a synovial fluid analysis is a group of tests that ensures that there are no disorders that might affect the joints.</p>
                        
                        <p>Fifth, there are saddle joints. Saddle joints are also known as sellar joints. They are located throughout the body; such as the shoulder, thumb, and the inner ear. But their function is that they permit sliding movement in two directions. The movement is very similar to the ball-and-socket mechanism.</p>
                        
                        <p>Lastly, we have the ellipsoidal joints. The function is the exact same as the saddle joint. Ellipsoidal joints are found in between the metacarpals (bones of the wrist) and phalanges ( bones of the fingers).</p>

                        <p>In nature, aggression among animals is not simply to win or to lose: it is an ego
battle in which it establishes a sense of dominance. Thus, it is no private affair and rather a
public display in front of numerous ‘spectators,’ in order to validate one’s sense of
superiority. To further investigate the behavioral science behind these aggressive
interactions, researchers at Stanford Medicine furtherly scrutinized neural activity,
particularly mirror neurons, in such situations.<br><br>In a study conducted by researchers, mice exemplified accentuated neural activity in
a region of the brain called the “rage center” both in engaging in aggression and observing
aggression. Particularly, mirror neurons are activated when an animal is doing or
witnessing said behavior. These mirror neurons exist in the ventromedial hypothalamus,
which is an evolutionary ancient region of the brain. This may indicate the prevalence of
mirror neurons since the primitive origin of animal biology.
<br><br>According to the lead of the study, Nirao Shah, a professor of psychiatry and
behavioral sciences, a group of particular brain cells are associated with aggression in
specifically male mice. In fact, it was deemed particularly straightforward in triggering
aggressive behavior from male mice. For instance, researchers introduced a male mouse
into the cage of another one of its kind. In the setup, a mouse was placed beside a
transparent divider to emulate the role of an observer. The result was as expected: the
provoked mouse resorted to aggressive tactics, particularly by tail-rattling. Although, what
is strikingly interesting is that the same group of activated neurons in the fighting mice
were also seen in the witnessing mouse. This suggests that these particular neurons are
mirror neurons.
<br><br>Mirror neurons are a type of brain cell that is equivalently activated when we
perform an action or observe the same action. According to the study, these neurons were
activated only in aggressive settings as opposed to other standard situations such as
grooming or exercising on a wheel. This notion was furtherly scrutinized by the Stanford
researchers.
<br><br>In further experimentation, provoked male mice did not confine their aggression to
other males, but attacks against female mice were observed. Though interaction between
male and female mice tend to showcase coupling behavior, in aggressive settings, male mice
demonstrated tail-rattling, a form of their aggression.
<br><br>This study is interesting as it gives insight to our own ability as humans to develop a
sense of culture through our means of empathizing and reciprocating emotions to others.
Though understanding the prevalence of these neurons in primates, the activity of mirror
neurons in a primal region of the brain proposes a possibility for the conservation of this
trait from mice to humans.</p>

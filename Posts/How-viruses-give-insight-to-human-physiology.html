                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Biology is universally defined as the study of life. It is the branch of natural science that studies living organisms and captures a large variety of biological fields, including human anatomy, physiology, immunology, botany, ecology, and many more. Surprisingly, a lot of what we know about the “study of life” actually comes from non-living materials and their interactions at the cellular level. In order to better understand human biology, scientists have studied viruses. We have grown to understand some of the essential processes that play out in human physiology through this interesting acellular specimen. Viruses affect all three domains of life, so the importance of virological research is immeasurable. The vast field of virology gives us insight into the internal mechanisms that help us sustain life and better understand what can go wrong when those functional systems are hijacked.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is a virus, and how do scientists categorize them within the three domains of life?</h2>
                        <p>The answer to this question is integral to virology and is one of the main ways they differ from cellular organisms. The three domains of life are exclusive to cellular life, such as prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Biologists, however, do not recognize viruses as cellular life. This is because viruses aren’t composed of cells but instead are simply composed of a protein shell and nucleic acid. Its protein shell, which may also be referred to as its “capsid,” helps protect the virus from external threats. Viruses are often extremely small, especially when compared to the host cells they infect. Their genomes are also very compact and have significantly less genetic information than the hosts they hijack. In order to replicate, viruses will often undergo the lytic cycle, which involves entry of the viral genome into the host cell. The transcription of the viral genome follows this, with the viral proteins being produced as a result. Once the viral genome is replicated, particles assemble inside the host and exit the cell, where free virions can then be transmitted to a new host.</p>
                        <p>If viruses are not considered to be cellular or alive, how do they compare to cellular life in terms of abundance? Well, viruses are quite plentiful and can be found everywhere. In fact, they generally outnumber cellular life in a 10 to 1 ratio. Viruses consists of approximately particles and can extend across vast distances beyond the Earth’s atmosphere if lined up. The ocean’s biomass is about 80% microbial with 20% of that quantity being occupied by viruses. Among the great diversity between the three domains of life, they all share a few distinct biochemical features. These features include a plasma membrane and phospholipid bilayer within their structures, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids, which are all produced by the union of carbon-based monomers and converted into more substantial molecules. In addition, they all match in ion distribution across the plasma membrane, for instance, the ratio of potassium, sodium, and calcium ions intracellularly and extracellularly. However, because viruses don’t fall under any of the three domains of life, they do not share some of the universal biochemical features among eukaryotes and prokaryotes. For example, viruses lack plasma membrane and phospholipid bilayer, proteins, nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, ribosomes and are incapable of carrying out metabolic processes, which explains why they must acquire these biological essentials via a host.</p>
                        <p>Interestingly enough, much of what we currently know about our cellular physiology comes from how viruses interact with cells. We also gained a better understanding of DNA replication and gene expression through viruses. Although viral gene expression closely resembles our own, they require appropriate space to encode factors due to their minute genomes and, as a result, must obtain this from a host. Earlier studies of viruses have helped develop our understanding of these events and originate from how most DNA viruses need to hijack the host DNA replication machinery to have their genes expressed in a cell during the S-phase of the cell cycle.</p>
                        <p>To better understand viruses, we must first explore the hypotheses regarding viral origins.  The first hypothesis concerning viral origins stemming from their non-homologous genes, which some think indicates that viruses predate the evolutionary timeline of cellular life. When biologists compared the genetic sequences of viruses and organisms that exhibited cellular life via a genetic database, there were often mismatches. This supports the speculation that viruses are not simplified versions or extensions of cellular life but rather a type of organism that is fundamentally different and possibly even older than those that exhibit cellular life. In regards to the last universal common ancestor, on a phylogenetic tree, the first viral origin hypothesis suggests that perhaps there was an ancient virosphere that captured the scope of viruses, or capsid-encoding organisms infecting cellular life which existed alongside or even before the three domains of life, bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. I think the data appears to strongly support this hypothesis and what we currently already know about our physiology. For instance, the simplicity of virus morphology and the studies regarding its evolution may suggest its earlier origins as well as explain why approximately 8% of human DNA is virally derived or how retrovirus genes have provided placental mammal mothers with the syncytin protein that allows the body not to reject or harm the baby.</p>
                        <p>Another aspect of viruses that we should explore to understand their influence better is their adaptability and evolution. One of the markers for biological success is adaptability, or the ability of an organism to interact with its environment, grow, and adopt more traits that increase its chances of survival. Viruses have tremendous potential for adapting, contributing to their biological success on Earth. Acellular life forms, such as viruses, will often evolve through mutations. Through natural selection, we may observe that some mutated variants will be better suited for survival and reproduction than others depending on their ecological experiences. The viral population should then undergo a genetic shift or evolution to display the more successful and advantageous variants. For instance, during the HIV-AIDS epidemic in 1981, HIV began to develop drug resistance to AZT (aka azidothymidine), an antiretroviral medication used to treat aids by disrupting its capacity as an RNA virus to enter the cell, replicate to turn into DNA that is inserted into the genome, which then exits the cell as RNA. Mutations in HIV, which is an RNA virus, can neglect errors that occur during the replication process. Through that error function, in an RNA virus population, you will now have developed either partially or completely resistant strains of the virus that display partial or full AZT resistance. In terms of SARS-COV.2 infection and the Remdesivir treatment, despite the mutated variants of SARS-COV.2, Remdesivir appears to produce the same effect by targeting the molecule essential for viral replication. Although the clinical trial research data is limited, it does not appear to have any constrained effect due to slight changes in the pathophysiology of SARS-COV.2 as a result of mutation.</p>
                        <p>The ability of viruses to evolve and adapt helps introduce some additional insights into human cell physiology. For instance, it allows us to make sense of how viruses drive the evolution of human cellular machinery and mechanisms. By manipulating key cellular components such as the genome, we can further study the innate mechanisms of the human body’s immunological response to viral variants and how we may introduce certain drugs to elicit pharmacological assistance. In humans, viruses have contributed to many physiological mechanisms that help us sustain life. Five percent of human breaths are procured from the oxygen viruses produce. In addition, the viruses that inhabit our microbiomes have helped make us healthier, as suggested by phage-mucus interactions. To elaborate, they interact via tail fibers and engage with any bacteria that try to invade the mucus layer and, by default, hijack those cells. This mechanism helps provide us with an extra layer of protection from pathogenic bacteria.</p>
                        <p>Despite being considered non-cellular, studying viruses can help biologists better understand the intricate nature of some of the world’s most fatal pathologies. Most notably, through virology, we can further explore the biology of cancer and viral transcription factors in a dormant state within the cytoplasm by the tumor suppressor protein Retinoblastoma or “Rb” for short. Dr. Britt Glaunsinger, a virologist and professor at UC Berkeley, studies virus-host interactions, precisely viral gene expression, and how cells regulate their large quantity of mRNA. The degradation of mRNA is a crucial factor in altering gene expression. This is often in response to certain stimuli and characterized by RNA’s varied stability. However, all viruses help transform cellular gene expression during infection. When our cells transition into the S-phase of the cell cycle, cyclin-dependent kinases will phosphorylate Rb to release the E2 family of transcription factors into the nucleus, which is dormant in the cytoplasm. The purpose is to transactivate those genes, and for viruses infecting cells that aren’t in the S-phase, they must utilize methods that give it access to the cellular machinery it requires regardless of the cell-cycle phase it is in. DNA viruses address the previous predicament by encoding a protein that binds Rb, forcing it to release the E2 transcription factors and enter the nucleus to turn on the genes necessary for the cell cycle.</p>
                        <p>E2 transcription factors were originally found because they transactivate the early two regions of the adenovirus genome, which gave us more insight into the specific mechanisms of the cell cycle. Due to how complex they are, cells have additional ways of detecting unscheduled transitions into the S-phase. One way is through the human tumor suppressor gene, p53, which is most notable for guarding the genome by blocking entry into the S-phase and initiating apoptosis, or cell-mediated death if it is unable to stop the transition into S-phase. Viruses will target p53 by inactivating the p53 tumor suppressor gene via a protein. P53 was first discovered as a 53 KiloDalton protein that would interact with the large T antigen from polyomavirus. This gene is often mutated in human cancers and is vital to the research conducted in cancer biology. Although the small DNA tumor viruses don’t directly cause any type of human cancer, they have shown biologists that the inactivation of an essential tumor suppressor protein can be detrimental to the livelihood of a cell and is crucial for cellular transformation and expression.</p>
                        <p>Cells undergo gene regulation because certain genes encode for certain proteins and proteins are the primary machinery of the cell. In fact, the end product of the central dogma of molecular biology is protein. Proteins are vital to the cell as they are responsible for directing cellular function. Thus, the abundance of genes expressed within a cell will determine its role and function within the human body. Cells desire to control the abundance of mRNA in the cytoplasm as mRNA is responsible for controlling protein synthesis, which is why viruses are drawn to hijacking that system. Viruses rely on the host cell’s machinery in order to survive and reproduce, so consequently, they rely on RNA decay for the degradation of viral enzyme fragments In regards to a viral infection, cells have numerous ways to detect viral invasion, and so naturally, they turn on factors that are antiviral and stimulate an immune response. Suppose the virus cleaves too many cellular RNAs. In that case, the host cell’s RNA has no chance to access the ribosomes, thereby enhancing the viral genes’ ability to become translated in an environment where the cellular genes are preferred. In biomedical science, scientists can often use their knowledge of the viral hijacking mechanisms to generate solutions involving early detection via clinical laboratory tests or even further explore their distinct mechanisms through the examination of their effects within other cancer pathologies.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>The field of virology is incredibly vast and crucial to the overall study of biology. Viruses have given us great insight into some of the many intricacies of human physiology by allowing biologists to examine their effects on body tissues and even at the microscopic cellular levels involving gene expression and regulation. Although viruses have a negative connotation in the public eye, they contribute to many of life’s essentials, from the oxygen we breathe to the gastrointestinal tract gut virome that plays an exciting role in our immunity and disease resistance. Most notable among the work of virologists include the work of Dr. Paul Turner and Dr. Britt Glaunsinger. Dr. Turner studies the adaptation of viruses in challenging environments, and Dr. Glaunsinger studies viral strategies used to alter gene expression in host cells. Their research is vital to our understanding of viruses and the specific tactics they employ to accomplish biological success. The dedicated and meticulous viral research of biologists brings us one step closer to mastering the innate, complex nature of viruses and, as a result, helps us better understand the field of human biology on a broader scale.</p>

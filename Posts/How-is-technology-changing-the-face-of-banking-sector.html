                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Since the 18th century, the banking sector has been developing, making it one of the world's oldest industries. It has evolved and improved with every year that has passed. Sectors and businesses with distinct technological solutions and the flexibility to adapt swiftly have an advantage as technologies develop.</p>
                        <p>In recent years, technology has played a bigger role in reshaping the banking industry! Long lineups and heaps of paperwork have long been stereotypes of banks. The demand for labour and documents has, however, significantly diminished as a result of technological advancements in the banking industry. The banking and finance sectors have also begun to embrace cutting-edge technology. Streamlining client services and updating systems are quickly gaining popularity in tech deployments.</p>
                        <p>The norm in recent years has been the use of mobile wallets, online deposits, e-bill payments, and other similar financial transactions. Due to rising client demand for digital banking services, artificial intelligence is at the centre of the transformation of banking into the digital age. Cashless payments grew 22% in October 2016 compared to October 2015, showing that Indians have been progressively growing their adoption of various digital payment mechanisms. This gain occurred in a year marked by <i>>&OpenCurlyQuote;notebandi&CloseCurlyQuote;</i>, the removal of 86% of the value of India's currency in circulation on November 8.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to the government's initiative to increase financial access by fusing no-frills bank accounts, the Aadhaar card, and mobile connection, the value of digital payments in India is predicted by CLSA to treble by 2026, hitting $1 trillion from $300 billion in 2021.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, the development of fintech and neo-banks, which are making the entire banking process more convenient and hassle-free for customers, is substantially in line with these improvements.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What does Technological Advancement bring to the Table?</h2>
                        <h3>Errors are reduced, and data is better protected</h3>
                        <p>When human precision and knowledge were the only factors used in banking, errors and defects were more noticeable. Since the introduction of computers, errors have nearly disappeared. Data misuse is uncommon since modern technology guarantees that your transactions are entirely secure and that your data is kept safe.</p>
                        <h3>Improved Customer Service</h3>
                        <p>The traditional banking system was time-consuming and demanding, which led to poor client experiences. You now spend less time performing banking-related tasks thanks to the development of net banking and mobile banking, which also provides hassle-free customer care even when you're not nearby.</p>
                        <h3>Profitability through Business Intelligence</h3>
                        <p>To increase the overall profitability of the sector, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has urged all Indian banks to employ business intelligence (BI). A business intelligence system offers information about past, present, and future trends. This data helps banks make informed decisions, which can ultimately increase earnings, productivity, efficiency, and profitability.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Tech Trends that Dominated the Banking Sector</h2>
                        <h3>Blocking</h3>
                        <p>Blockchain technology is being used by banks more and more to adopt risk management strategies, making it hard for hackers to acquire personal data like client bank information. By replicating recent asset deals, the industry is already experimenting with blockchain technology. It helps to boost security, increase efficiency, and enable cheaper, quicker transactions.</p>
                        <h3>Biometrics</h3>
                        <p>Companies like WhatsApp, Google, and Amazon are creating their own payment systems as people's reliance on cash declines. Additionally, biometric payments are altering how individuals use their phones to make purchases. After scanning their finger or using face recognition technology, payments are done in a couple of seconds.</p>
                        <h3>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                        <p>In order to offer their customers individualised, just-in-time services, banks primarily rely on AI and machine learning. Automating banking processes with AI and machine learning also enhances client service, lending options, and credit services. Additionally, they combat fraud.</p>
                        <h3>Banking on the Cloud</h3>
                        <p>Most banks have started the transition to cloud-based banking. Banks will synchronise their entire operation and remove data and operational hurdles in customer service, finance, risk, and other areas by using the cloud. By preserving their old business model while providing clients with digital experiences, this increases cost effectiveness.</p>
                        <h3>Chatbots</h3>
                        <p>Banks will start to provide various services utilising a speech interface as consumers become more accustomed to voice-based interactions. For instance, chatbots in the finance sector reduce transaction times by roughly four minutes. Additionally, it would make it simple and affordable for banks to get customer feedback.</p>

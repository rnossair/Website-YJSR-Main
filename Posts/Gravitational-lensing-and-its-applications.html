                        <p>The <i>deflection of light</i> was first observed by Arthur Eddington, Frank Watson Dyson, and fellow collaborators during the total solar eclipse on May 29th, 1919. The scientists studied the observed change in position of the stars as they passed near the Sun on the celestial sphere.</p>
                        <p>The deflection of light demonstrates the idea that the light from stars passing close to the Sun was slightly bent, causing the stars to appear slightly out of position. This was later directly confirmed by Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, which suggested that gravity could bend light. Einstein was also the first person to calculate the correct value for light bending.</p>

                        <p>According to Einstein’s general theory of relativity, time and space are fused together in a four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.</p>
                        <p>The phenomenon of Gravitational Lensing was predicted by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. This theory suggests that a large mass could distort spacetime, or in the other words, gravity is the curvature of space-time. The path of light bends and follows as the curvature of spacetime occurs.</p>

                        <p>When a massive distribution of matter between a light source and observer occurs, such as a galaxy cluster, it creates a gravitational field that distorts and magnifies the light from the source, as it travels towards the observer.</p>
                        <p>The body causing the light to curve, the galaxy cluster in this scenario, is called a gravitational lens. This lens acts on all kinds of electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic radiation.</p>
                        <p>When a distant light source passes through a gravitational lens, a halo, or ring of light appears around the object. This curvature of light around the gravitational lens is observed as the bending path of light, otherwise known as an Einstein Ring.</p>
                        <div>
                            <img src="../assets/others/grav_lev_deepthy3.jpg" class="illus-img">
                            <p class="img-cap">The gravity of a luminous red galaxy (LRG) has gravitationally distorted the light from a much more distant blue galaxy. More typically, such light bending results in two discernible images of the distant galaxy, but here the lens alignment is so precise that the background galaxy is distorted into a horseshoe – a nearly complete ring.<br>Credit: ESA/Hubble & NASA</p>

                        <p>The different types of lensing include:</p>
                        <h3>Strong lensing</h3>
                        <p>Strong lensing occurs when there are easily visible distortions such as the formation of Einstein rings, multiple images etc. It is also observed in radio and x-ray regimes as well. When multiple images are produced, there will be a relative time delay between two paths. For example, the lensed object will be observed in one image before the other image.</p>

                        </div>
                        <h3>Weak Lensing</h3>
                        <p>Weak lensing is observed when the distortions of background sources are much smaller and can only be detected by a statistical analysis of a large number of sources which find distortions that are coherent. This effect is being studied for the cosmic microwave background as well as galaxy surveys. Weak lensing is also used as a tool to map out the location of all galaxy clusters in the universe, including those that can’t directly be seen. Astronomers use the effects of weak lensing to study the distribution of dark matter in the universe, using the statistical properties of the shapes observed from very distant galaxies and quasars.</p>
                        <h3>Micro-lensing</h3>
                        <p>Micro-lensing happens when no distortion in a shape is visible but the amount of light received from background objects change in time. In extreme cases, a star in a distant galaxy can act as a micro-lens and magnify another star much farther away. The first example of micro-lensing observed was the star ‘MACS J1149 Lensed Star 1’, also known as Icarus, and is the second most distant individual star to have been detected so far, at approximately 14 billion light-years from Earth.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center"><b>. . . . . . . . . . . . . .</b></p>
                        <p>Gravitational lensing can be utilised for 2 main reasons.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li style="font-weight: 900">Detection and Characterization of the Properties of Dark Matter</li>
                            <p style="margin-top: 0;">Gravitational lensing provides information on the expansion rate, geometry, and distribution of mass in the Universe, especially dark matter.</p>
                            <p>Lensed images act as probes of matter distributed in the galaxy clusters and indicate that most matter in galaxy clusters is, in fact, dark matter.  For example, dark matter does not emit light. The distribution of these lensed images reflect the distribution of both visible and dark matter.</p>
                            <li style="font-weight: 900">Identification of Distant Galaxies</li>
                            <p style="margin-top: 0;">Gravitational lensing is analogous to looking through a giant magnifying glass. This magnification permits observation of objects that would otherwise be too far away and faint to be seen. Hubble makes use of this to study objects that would otherwise be beyond the sensitivity of its 2.4-metre-diameter primary mirror, allowing us to observe and study the most distant galaxies humanity has yet to come across.</p>
                            <p>As distant galaxies are extremely faint, gravitational lenses enhance Hubble’s view of the universe. Besides distorting the image of a background galaxy, gravitational lensing amplifies its light as well. Hubble can thus see fainter and more distant galaxies when viewing it through a lensing galaxy cluster, as it’s akin to having an extra lens that is the size of the galaxy cluster.</p>

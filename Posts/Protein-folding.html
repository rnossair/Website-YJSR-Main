                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>It is common to think of proteins as nutrients that can build muscle and provide strength, but in biology, proteins are small molecules that play key roles in a multitude of bodily functions. Before they can be of use to the body, these proteins must first undergo several lesser-known stages that guide their creation, development, and ultimately "folding."</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What are Proteins?</h2>
                        <p>Proteins are the essential molecules that are involved in most of the chemical reactions taking place in the human body. Some protein functions include becoming antibodies to help fight against pathogens, becoming messenger proteins that signal certain processes to happen, becoming enzymes that participate in chemical reactions in the body, and more. Created from genetic instructions in our DNA, proteins can take shape in many different forms depending on their amino acid building blocks (which are acquired through food), intermolecular bonds, and folding structure.</p>
                        <p>All amino acids share a universal structure: a central carbon (C) atom at the center, a hydrogen (H) atom, an amino group made up of two hydrogen atoms and one nitrogen (N) atom, a carboxyl group made from two oxygen (O) atoms, one carbon atom, and one hydrogen atom, and an R-group side chain. Through peptide bonds that attach carboxyl groups of different amino acids together, all proteins’ primary structure is formed. This primary structure is always 2-D, taking shape as either lines or coils. The only variation between most proteins is their amino acids’ unique R-group side chain, which can be hydrophilic, hydrophobic, negative, positive, and uncharged. These characteristics and their consequent interactions with other amino acids determine the length, shape, and sequence of the protein during the initial protein construction and later protein folding.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Protein Folding</h2>
                        <p>As proteins start as 2-D and a 3-D shape is needed for them to properly function, protein folding is a necessary process in the protein life cycle. Protein folding is when a 2-D and flat primary structure of a protein “folds” into its 3-D shape through four stages. The unique product of protein folding determines the purpose of the protein.</p>
                        <p>Protein folding begins with the primary structure as mentioned above, then moves on to the secondary structure, tertiary structure, and quaternary structure.</p>
                        <p>After completing the primary structure, proteins in the second stage form two types of structures known as regular-sub structures. These structures depend on the arrangement of amino acids in the primary structure and are most commonly found as chains of either α helices or β pleated sheets, where α helices are a coiled, ribbon-like shape and β pleated sheets are a zigzag, handheld-fan-like pattern. α helices and β pleated sheets can exist as a singular module or as two modules together on one chain known as a polypeptide chain. Intermolecular hydrogen bonds found in the peptide backbone of the protein help to maintain these secondary structures’ shapes.</p>
                        <p>The tertiary structure is when the 3-D shape of a protein starts conforming to its R-groups interactions. For example, hydrophilic R-group side chains will generally exist on the outer parts of a protein because they are more likely to contact water there as compared to hydrophobic R-groups existing in the inner parts of a protein with fewer surfaces for water contact. The tertiary structure is also influenced by bonds such as hydrogen, ionic, dipole-dipole, and more.</p>
                        <p>The quaternary structure is rare as many proteins are only processed up until the tertiary stage. Thus, proteins that make it to the fourth stage are often complex proteins made up of multiple polypeptide chains. Weak bonds such as hydrogen and disulfide bonds keep these polypeptide chains together.</p>
                        <p>Protein in its native 3-D shape can take up many unique shapes that affect its purpose. Certain proteins can become enzymes that have a specific shape carved into them. The shape of these particles perfectly fits the substrate to be broken down. The same process is employed by amino acid-derived growth hormones. In a manner that is similar to how enzymes and substrates are locked together by their unique receptors, these hormones identify their target cells in the body.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Errors in Protein Folding</h2>
                        <p>Much like mitosis or cell replication, protein folding is prone to failures that can greatly damage the body. In the case of mitosis where a cell can become cancerous due to DNA replication errors, protein misfolding can lead to diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, Marfan syndrome, and more.</p>
                        <p>A few causes for protein misfolding:
                            <ul class="cont-list">
                                <li>a DNA mutation that encodes the creation of a different amino acid than intended,</li>
                                <li>a mistake during DNA decoding to create proteins,</li>
                                <li>undesired environmental factors that lower the chances of correct protein folding,</li>
                                <li>and the fact that proteins do not fold 100% correctly all the time.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Protein misfolding results in nonfunctional proteins, leading to a shortage of proteins that carry out crucial activities in the body. For instance, misfolded proteins responsible for breaking down toxins within the liver cannot properly do their jobs, thus allowing these toxins to build up and damage the body. Furthermore, mutations in the DNA that codes for the creation of insulin have been linked to protein misfolding, a decrease in insulin production, and the appearance of early-onset diabetes.</p>
                        <p>Proteins that have misfolded often take on strange shapes such as the presence of their hydrophobic end on the outside and other their hydrophilic end on the inside. Moreover, these proteins can form clumps like cancerous tumors, albeit on a much smaller scale. Scientists hypothesized that these clumps of misfolded proteins are responsible for Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases.</p>

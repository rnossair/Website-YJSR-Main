                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>As people, we often lie or are lied to, whether it be a small white one or a massive secret, which is only a part of human nature. These are some ways to tell if someone is lying to you, so that you may have a better understanding of how to protect yourself from these lies.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Verbal Signs</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>When many people lie, they are unable to have a full story and therefore, bring up random points without much detail. This is due to the fact that it never happened, and so due to that fact, there are no real details.</li>
                            <li><b>Speaking in fragments:</b> when people speak in fragments, it often means that they have to think hard about what they are going to say next, as opposed to remembering it and already having the full story in their memory.</li>
                            <li><b>Lack of emotion, or too much:</b> If someone doesn't seem to have any emotion related to a situation, it can often be because it didn't happen and there's none. The most common form is when people have too much emotion. This can be done through screaming and will often come off as more believable to the recipients, who will make up their own emotions for the stories they are telling.</li>
                            <li><b>Voice Cracking:</b> When a person's voice cracks uncontrollably, it can indicate that they are lying or are nervous about their lie, and their body is expressing this through their voice, but this will normally only happen in extreme situations of fear.</li>
                            <li>When people are lying, it is typical for them to get louder when their story is brought into question, as in trying to support it, but it can become more aggressive as a result. That volume may be used to try and make the person stop questioning or scare them off. It's more used as a defense mechanism.</li>
                            <li>Repeating questions before answering gives them more time to remind themselves or try to think of what would fit in with their story and gives them more time to come up with another lie. This can also be used in a similar way as when people say ‘uhh’ during a lie, which can also be an indicator of if someone is lying.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Non-verbal signs</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Avoiding eye contact:</b> This is often used as a way to deflect guilt during a lie when the lying party would feel guilty about what they are doing. They use it as a way to try and get away from being caught in the lie by how they are moving or to try and think of a lie on the spot and get ideas from the world around them in order to support it.</li>
                            <li><b>Fidgeting:</b> This shows that they have nervous energy. This will be most apparent when they are under stress about what will happen when they are caught, or if they are generally a bad liar. Someone will be unable to keep their nerves under control.</li>
                            <li><b>Overcompensating:</b> Often, people will try to compensate for what they lack in their lies by acting strangely.They might make too much eye contact or just become generally awkward while lying, especially if they normally aren't. This can be used in most situations while the liar attempts to make the story more believable.</li>
                            <li><b>Putting up a wall:</b> When lying, this can be an obvious sign that the liar is concerned with what will happen if they do, and then they will try and put things between you in order to try and get away faster. This generally happens when things begin going against what they had planned.</li>

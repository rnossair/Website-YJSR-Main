                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Music listening, dating back almost 35,000 years ago, has been proved to stimulate and enhance brain function, cognitive activity, and mental well-being. Music and brain surveys conducted by The American Association of Retired Persons (commonly known as AARP) in 2020, The American Music Therapy Association, and The Bangert et al. (2006) study all reveal  fascinating research on the impact of music to the brain. Continutous exposure to music since early childhood has proven time after time that music does, in fact, positively affect brain performance.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Musical Exposure To The Brain</h2>
                        <p>The survey conducted by AARP revealed that 68% of subjects who had a high ability to learn new things efficiently had music exposure implemented in their early childhoods. In contrast, 50% of subjects who were not exposed to music at an early age rated their quality of understanding and life very poorly. The Music of Brain Health survey conducted by AARP also discovered that participants over 50 years old who had constant musical exposure had high rates of cognitive brain function. Music can indeed improve brain function as well as overall mental well-being.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">A Direct Linkage Of Music And Language</h2>
                        <p>The Bangert et al. (2006) study on contrasting non-musicians and musicians explored brain activation using neuroimaging—a technique used to study the structure and function of the central nervous system. The study focused on activation areas in the brain that contribute to the anatomy of language. Two critical areas that play a major role in speech and language are Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area. Located in the frontal part of the left hemisphere of the brain, Broca’s area is responsible for accuracy in speech and languages, and the ability to form articulation. Wernicke’s area, found in the posterior third of the upper temporal convolution of the left hemisphere, is responsible for written and spoken language processing. Interestingly, musicians that participated in The Bangert et al. (2006) study showed stronger activations in the Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area than that of non-musicians. This research could support the hypothesis that, if an individual engages in musical activity, then that individual will possess better speech and language skills.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Musical Therapy</h2>
                        <p>As various studies have proven repeatedly, music is beneficial for a healthy brain, but only the future can really tell what music has in store for medical researchers. Music, recently taking a clinical role in medicine, is being used as a therapy by different age groups and cultures. Specifically, music can be used for those who suffer from acquired brain injuries (ABI)— strokes, tumors, anoxic episodes, alcohol and drug abuse, and infections. The methods of music therapy, according to the American Music Therapy Association, can include rhythmic auditory stimulation, vocal interventions, song-writing, and therapeutic instrumental music performance. The goals of these therapies are to improve a patient's cognitive abilities, motor function, communication, and mental health. Although there are few negative aspects of music therapy, including but not limted to,“amusia”- an auditory processing disorder, where music can not be perceived, or it is perceived as irritating, and great fatigue, it is found to have more benefits than disadvantages.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Researchers and musicians have gone great lengths to discover the critical role music plays in regards to the human body. The fascinating science behind the perception of music continues to be explored and appreciated around the world. As music therapy becomes more accepted in the field of medicine, more people are able to benefit from the advantages of it in a clinical way. Whether it is playing relaxing music during a study session, engaging in playing musical instruments or dancing to a 3 hour apple music playlist, you are exposing your brain to the wide benefits of music. As John A. Logan once said, “Music is the medicine of the mind.”</p>

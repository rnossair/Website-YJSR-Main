            <p>
              Carbon Dioxide is not a foreign phrase to anyone who’s taken an
              elementary-level science class. It is infamous for its
              contributions to our earth’s greatest issues, global warming,
              climate change, and the greenhouse effect, all intertwined. Many
              have been fed the same information, carbon dioxide acts as a cap
              which traps heat- which should be released into space- in the
              atmosphere. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is one of, if not the primary
              source behind climate change.
            </p>
            <p>
              [4] One main strategy for reducing the effects of climate change
              is reducing carbon emissions, through acts such as turning off
              unused lights, carpooling and utilizing bikes and walks for
              reaching destinations. However, according to the Intergovernmental
              Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), reducing emissions simply isn’t
              enough to make a difference. The effects of greenhouse gases
              active today will remain circulating throughout our atmosphere
              regardless of the emissions we reduce. Hence, the IPCC has
              confirmed that we need to find methods to remove carbon dioxide
              from the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              One such method in development is carbon capture and
              sequestration.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">
              CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION PROCESS
            </h2>
            <p>
              The idea for the first carbon capture plant originated in 1938,
              and the first significant effort to inject CO2 into the ground got
              underway in Texas's Sharon Ridge oilfield in 1972. 24 years later,
              Norway began operating Sleipner in the North Sea, the first
              integrated carbon capture and storage project in history. There
              are already 43 large-scale, commercial carbon capture and storage
              facilities located throughout the world. 18 of these are now in
              use, while 16 are for industrial purposes. Carbon capture and
              storage (CCS) reduces carbon emissions by removing them from the
              atmosphere, and experts believe it may be key in the fight against
              global warming. First, carbon dioxide emissions from industrial
              processes or fossil fuels burning are transported from their point
              of production and then stored deep underground.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">BREAKDOWN</h2>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 500">CAPTURE</h4>
            <p>
              [1] Power plants, Industrial processes, gas facilities, and the
              open air, are sources from which CO2 is captured. In order to
              remove or scrub the CO2 from the environment, 3 different
              techniques can be applied: POST-COMBUSTION, PRE-COMBUSTION AND
              OXYFUEL COMBUSTION In post-combustion, as the name suggests, CO2
              is removed after the fossil fuel is burnt. It takes place in most,
              if not all power plants and the CO2 is scrubbed from the exhaust.
              This technology is the most reliable and understood,d and also
              applied in other scenarios. In pre-combustion, CO2 is trapped
              before the fuel is burnt. The fossil fuel is partially burnt,
              forming synthetic gas, which CO2 can now be easily captured from.
              This technique cannot be applied to power plants, but, however,
              works perfectly for fertilizer, gas and power production. In
              oxyfuel combustion, oxygen is used to burn fossil fuels rather
              than air. Cooling causes the water to condense, producing nearly
              pure CO2 that may be transported and stored. Oxyfuel combustion
              technologies used in electricity plants are commonly referred to
              as "zero emission" procedures since almost all of the CO2 is
              collected. Since it's likely that some CO2 will dissolve in the
              condensed water, additional treatment steps may be necessary. Even
              though it might be the most efficient approach of the three, the
              initial oxygen-burning process requires a lot of energy.
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 500">TRANSPORT</h4>
            <p>
              [1] CO2 is then transferred to suitable storage sites. Pipelines
              are one of the cheapest and most commonly used transport systems.
              Pipelines in the United States facilitate oil production, where
              the extracted CO2 is injected, producing more oil. For small-scale
              transport and application, ships and road tankers are famously
              acquired.
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 500">STORAGE</h4>
            <p>
              [1] There are various ways in which the extracted CO2 can be
              stored, however, deep geological storage and mineral storage are
              the main ways. Deep geological formations are also referred to as
              geo-sequestration. Through geo-sequestration, CO2 is converted to
              a high, pressure, liquid-resembling form, which is referred to as
              supercritical CO2. This semi-runny liquid is injected into
              sedimentary rocks. The CO2 is considered trapped, and unlikely to
              seep out. Unmineable coal, that is, coal which is unable or too
              difficult to be mined, is also a storage location for extracted
              CO2. Permeable coal allows CO2 to penetrate, which causes the coal
              to then release methane, which is recovered and used for fuels in
              various systems. Saline aquifers are another storage location,
              serving as deep rock formations with highly concentrated salt
              water which acts as a sponge to absorb CO2. These are one of the
              most advantageous storage methods, as saline aquifers are large in
              abundance and have large storage potential. However, as they
              produce no byproduct which reaps profit, they are said to be more
              expensive.
            </p>

            <h2 class="sub-heading">RISKS OF CARBON CAPTURE</h2>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 500">POTENTIAL LEAKS</h4>
            <p>
              Based on the above-described methods, one’s mind would immediately
              jump to the possibility of leakage. The truth is, if CO2 fails to
              remain in a liquid state, it is more than likely to leek and seep
              into surroundings areas. These leaks pose environmental and safety
              issues, ie soil contamination and pollution. This leaking gas may
              also seep into populated areas, posing health risks to those in
              the vicinity.
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 500">DANGEROUS INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD</h4>
            <p>
              Infrastructure involved with CCS also poses an issue. Pipelines,
              mentioned above, are notorious for disrupting local ecosystems and
              displacing wildlife. Additionally, pipelines are vulnerable to
              several natural disasters, meaning that if impacted by such, CO2
              is likely to leak and evoke hazardous results.
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-weight: 500">PUBLIC PERCEPTION</h4>
            <p>
              The way the general public views CCS is also significant. How will
              people react if a ground-level injection of an invisible gas
              occurs close to their homes? Would they have faith that it would
              be kept secure and free from any threat of leakage or escape? How
              will businesses explain CCS to a population of consumers that are
              growing more concerned?
            </p>
            <br />
            <h2 class="sub-heading">EVALUATION OF EFFICIENCY</h2>
            <p>
              While generally perceived as a breakthrough in the fight against
              climate change, different experts hold differing views on the
              long-term impacts of CCS. Mark Z. Jacobson(Staford University),
              has suggested that CCS can cause more harm, than good. [6] To
              compare the actual and potential efficiencies of these two types
              of plants, Jacobson looked at a number of scenarios, including
              what would happen if the carbon capture technologies were powered
              by renewable electricity rather than natural gas and if the same
              amount of renewable electricity needed to power the equipment were
              instead used to replace the coal plant's electricity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although the effectiveness of carbon capture technology is
              typically estimated to be between 85 and 90 per cent, neither of
              these facilities achieved that goal. Even without taking into
              consideration upstream emissions, the average efficiency of the
              coal plant's equipment over a 6-month period was only 55.4%. [5]
              The cost of the equipment and also the processes involved, are
              also greatly expensive, outweighing many of the pros associated
              with the procedure.[3] The Global CCS Institute’s report asserts
              that the biggest obstruction to realizing the full potential of
              carbon capture and storage technology is that the market still
              does not provide any substantial incentives for companies to gain
              a full return on investment. The need of the hour is policies that
              fully support investments in carbon capture and storage.[2]

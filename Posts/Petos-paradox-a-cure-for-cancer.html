                        <p>For decades, cancer has afflicted humanity, striking when you least expect it. Since the time of the dinosaurs, mankind has been plagued by this sickness.</p>
                        <p>Despite billions of dollars spent on cancer research, no cure has been discovered. This begins the question of why cancer is so difficult to treat.</p>
                        <p>For starters, there are over 100 different forms of cancer, and no single cure exists for all of them. Because they lack the intricacy of a tumor in an actual organism, cancer treatments developed using cell lines produced in labs from cultures of human tumors were found to be useless when administered to the real tumor. As a result, they are ineffectual in real-life situations.</p>
                        <p>Cancer cells also exist in numerous populations, and genetic alterations can arise within cells. Furthermore, malignant malignancies are complex systems that evolve and adapt over time. To beat them, we need to create complicated experimental systems, as well as monitoring and therapy choices that can respond to changes in cancer.</p>
                        <p>It was named after Richard Peto, an epidemiologist who discovered the link between time and cancer while examining tumor formation in mice. Peto discovered that the duration of exposure to the carcinogen benzpyrene increased the likelihood of cancer progression (a substance with a formula C20H12 that reacts and binds with DNA, resulting in mutation and eventually cancer). Different animals' cells are often the same size. A mouse's cells aren't any smaller than a human's. It just has fewer total cells and a smaller size.</p>
                        <p>Fewer cells and a shorter lifespan should indicate a lesser likelihood of things going wrong or cells mutating, or at least that's what it should imply. People live 50 times longer and have 3000 times more cells than mice, although cancer rates in humans and mice are nearly identical. Even blue whales, which have 3,000 times the number of cells as humans, do not appear to develop cancer. How is it possible?</p>
                        <p>Evolution and hypertumors are the most common theories for this puzzle. <br>Animal sizes have continued to grow since multicellular organisms originated 600 million years ago. Mitotic cell divisions enhance the chances of cells becoming corrupted. As a result, the collective's cancer defenses had to be strengthened. Those who did not perish.</p>
                        <p>Cancer does not strike without warning. It's a process that involves a lot of small mistakes and mutations in a lot of different genes in the same cell. These genes are known as proto-oncogenes, and their mutations are usually concerning. When a cell makes a mistake, it usually kills itself; but, with the correct mutation, a cell can lose its ability to destroy itself. A further mutation gives the cell the ability to conceal. Another option is to issue a resource request. Another, and it will swiftly multiply. However, tumor suppressor genes act as an antagonist to these oncogenes. They either stop these essential mutations from developing or tell the cell to terminate itself if it can't be repaired. It turns out that huge creatures can be dangerous.</p>
                        <p>As a result, elephant cells require more mutations to produce a tumor than mice cells. They aren't immune, but they are more resistant. This adaptation is likely to come at some cost, but experts aren't sure what it is. Tumor suppressors may cause elephants to age faster later in life or hinder the healing of injuries. We still don't know. However, the paradox's answer could be something quite different.</p>
                        <p>Cancer might be viewed as a failure of collaboration. Cells normally work together to build structures such as organs, tissue, and immune system components. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are selfish and only think about themselves in the short term. If they succeed, they develop tumors, which are large cancer clusters that can be difficult to treat.</p>
                        <p>However, growing a tumor is difficult. The rapid multiplication of millions or billions of cancer cells necessitates a lot of resources and energy. The amount of nutrients they can take from the body limits their ability to grow. As a result, tumor cells fool the body into creating new blood arteries that go straight to the tumor, feeding it and destroying it. Here, cancer cells' nature may prove to be their undoing. Because cancer cells are naturally unstable, they can continue to mutate. Some of them are more agile than their peers. If they do this for a long time, one of the copies of the duplicates of the original cancer cell may begin to think of itself as an individual again and become a cancer cell. This means that the initial tumor, like the body, becomes an enemy, battling for the same limited supplies and nutrients. As a result, the newly altered cells may form a hypertumor.</p>
                        <p>If cancer suppression has repeatedly evolved as a feature, then a basic study into the life histories, genomes, and cell biology of a variety of organisms can lead to improved therapeutic options. If Peto's Paradox remains true across the tree of life, and enormous long-lived organisms have less cancer than their body size suggests, it means a variety of systems exist to inhibit neoplastic growth and combat cancer. Every time a putative mechanism for cancer suppression in a species is discovered, there is a chance that new therapeutic targets and approaches will be discovered.</p>
                        <p>We are now in the midst of the sixth major extinction on Earth, with extinction rates potentially 1000 times higher than in the past. Peto's Paradox study can aid cancer prevention studies while also fostering an appreciation for biodiversity and the need to conserve species all over the world.</p>

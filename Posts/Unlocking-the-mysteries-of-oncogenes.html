                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for over 9.6 million deaths in 2018 alone <sup>[1]</sup>. Cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth and proliferation of cells that have acquired mutations in critical genes. One class of genes that play a key role in the development of cancer are oncogenes. In this article, we will delve into the scientific details and biological processes that underlie the function of oncogenes and how they contribute to cancer development.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What are Oncogenes?</h2>
                        <p>Oncogenes are a class of genes that have the potential to cause cancer when mutated or overexpressed. These genes were initially identified in retroviruses, which are RNA viruses that can cause cancer in animals <sup>[2]</sup>. The term "oncogene" was coined by the virologist Peyton Rous in the 1960s to describe the genetic material responsible for the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells <sup>[3]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>Oncogenes can be classified into several categories based on their mode of action. Some oncogenes promote cell growth and division by stimulating the cell cycle, while others prevent apoptosis, which is programmed cell death that occurs when a cell is damaged or no longer needed <sup>[4]</sup>. Additionally, some oncogenes can promote angiogenesis, the process by which new blood vessels are formed, which is essential for tumour growth and metastasis <sup>[5]</sup>. Oncogenes can also play a role in DNA repair and chromosomal stability, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of the genome <sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Mechanisms of Oncogene Activation</h2>
                        <p>Oncogenes can be activated in several ways, including point mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and gene amplification <sup>[7]</sup>. Point mutations occur when a single nucleotide in the DNA sequence is altered, resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the gene. Chromosomal rearrangements occur when a portion of one chromosome is transferred to another chromosome, leading to the fusion of two genes. Gene amplification occurs when the number of copies of a gene is increased, resulting in an overexpression of the protein encoded by the gene <sup>[8]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>One well-known example of oncogene activation is the BCR-ABL fusion gene found in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) <sup>[9]</sup>. This fusion gene is created by a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which results in the fusion of the BCR gene on chromosome 22 with the ABL gene on chromosome 9. The resulting protein, BCR-ABL, has constitutive kinase activity, which promotes cell growth and division. Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have been developed to specifically target the BCR-ABL fusion protein and have been highly effective in treating CML <sup>[10]</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Oncogenes and Cancer Development</h2>
                        <p>Oncogenes play a critical role in the development and progression of cancer. When oncogenes are activated, they can promote uncontrolled cell growth and division, which leads to the formation of tumours. Additionally, oncogenes can inhibit apoptosis, allowing damaged cells to continue to grow and divide, and can promote angiogenesis, which provides the necessary nutrients and oxygen for tumour growth <sup>[11]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>One well-studied oncogene is the RAS family of genes, which encode small GTPases that are involved in cell signalling pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation <sup>[12]</sup>. Mutations in RAS genes are found in a wide variety of cancers, including pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancer. RAS mutations result in constitutive activation of the RAS protein, which promotes cell growth and division. Targeted therapies for RAS mutations have been challenging to develop due to the complex signalling pathways involved, but ongoing research is exploring alternative approaches such as targeting downstream effectors of the RAS signalling pathway <sup>[13]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>Another oncogene that has been extensively studied is the MYC gene, which encodes a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell growth and division [14]. MYC is often overexpressed in cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis. MYC overexpression can promote uncontrolled cell growth and division, inhibit apoptosis, and promote angiogenesis <sup>[15]</sup>. Targeting MYC has proven to be challenging due to its role in normal cell function, but recent advances in understanding the regulation of MYC expression have provided new avenues for therapeutic development <sup>[16]</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Oncogene Targeted Therapies</h2>
                        <p>Targeted therapies are a type of cancer treatment that aim to specifically target the molecular abnormalities that drive cancer development and progression. Oncogene targeted therapies have shown promise in treating a variety of cancers, particularly those with specific oncogene mutations or overexpression.</p>
                        <p>One example of an oncogene targeted therapy is the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) with the BCR-ABL fusion gene mentioned earlier. TKIs such as imatinib specifically target the constitutively active BCR-ABL kinase and have revolutionised the treatment of CML, leading to improved outcomes and survival rates for patients <sup>[17]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>Another example of an oncogene targeted therapy is the use of BRAF inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma with BRAF mutations. BRAF is a kinase that is frequently mutated in melanoma, resulting in constitutive activation of the MAPK signalling pathway, which promotes cell growth and division <sup>[18]</sup>. BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib specifically target the mutated BRAF kinase and have been shown to improve survival rates in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma <sup>[19]</sup>.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Challenges and Future Directions</h2>
                        <p>While oncogene targeted therapies have shown promising results, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One major challenge is the development of resistance to targeted therapies. Cancer cells can evolve to bypass the targeted therapy and continue to grow and divide, leading to relapse and treatment failure. Ongoing research is exploring ways to overcome resistance by combining targeted therapies with other treatments or developing new targeted therapies that address the mechanisms of resistance <sup>[20]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>Another challenge is the identification of new oncogene targets. While several oncogenes have been extensively studied, there are likely many more oncogenes that have yet to be discovered or fully characterised. Advances in genomics and proteomics are providing new opportunities for identifying novel oncogene targets and developing targeted therapies <sup>[21]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>Oncogenes are a critical component in the development and progression of cancer. Activation of oncogenes can promote uncontrolled cell growth and division, inhibit apoptosis, and promote angiogenesis, leading to tumour formation and metastasis. Oncogene targeted therapies have shown promise in treating a variety of cancers, but challenges such as resistance and identification of new oncogene targets need to be addressed. Ongoing research in this area is essential for improving outcomes and survival rates for cancer patients.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              For hundreds of years, humans speculated that planets exist outside of our solar system. This was only confirmed thirty years ago when two planets, Poltergeist and Phobetor, were found orbiting a pulsar. Just two years later, a third planet by the name of Draugr was found in the same system. Exoplanets were defined as planets outside of the solar system which usually orbited another star. This opened many news doors and theories in the world of astronomy. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the first discovery in 1992, NASA has confirmed more than 5,000 exoplanets in the Milky Way. With the help of instruments—such as the Kepler Space Telescope and the James Webb Telescope—astronomers have researched the potential of life beyond the Earth. Calculating size, weight, and distance, scientists created a system to classify exoplanets into four main categories: Super-Earths, Gas Giants, Neptunian Planets, and Terrestrial Planets. Although they were grouped because of their similar elements, they still vary drastically from one another. This has led to the ultimate question of whether these planets will one day be able to support human life.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Gas Giants</h2>
            <p>
              As taken from the name, Gas Giants are composed of gasses such as
              helium and hydrogen. They usually do not have any solid surfaces,
              except for a solid core at the very center. These exoplanets are
              most similar to Jupiter and Saturn, however they are much larger.
              Sometimes, these planets are referred to as Hot Jupiters because
              they orbit very close to their stars causing temperatures to go up
              to thousands of degrees. Because they are so close to their stars,
              Gas Giants have a small orbit. Some can finish a full orbit in
              just a couple hours! However, this can cause the Gas Giant to be
              unstable and create a “wobble” in space. This means that the
              planet pulls on other stellar objects nearby and can cause a shift
              in the spectrum of light observed. This is helpful when trying to
              discover an exoplanet. 
            </p>
           
          <p>Gas Giants were the first type of
              exoplanets discovered, and still continue the growth of
              astronomical discoveries. Formations of planets for hundreds of
              years relied on the planets in our Solar System. However, the
              discovery of Gas Giants have allowed scientists to hypothesize
              other ways planets can form. This is because our most similar
              planets, Jupiter and Saturn, have faraway orbits from the Sun. It
              was originally hypothesized that the planets were formed farther
              away. However, with the discovery of Gas Giants, it may be
              possible that Jupiter and Saturn were formed much closer to the
              Sun and drifted further away over the course of billions of years.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Neptunian Planets</h2>
            <p>
              Inferred by the label, Neptunian Planets are gaseous and are
              similar in size to Neptune and Uranus. Neptune, in comparison to
              Earth, has about four times its radius. However, some Neptunian
              planets have been found to be smaller than Neptune with similar
              composition. Discoveries such as these help open the door to new
              theories of planet formation as they have never been observed
              before. Almost 2,000 Neptunian planets have been confirmed thus
              far, making it one of the most common exoplanets in the Milky Way.
              Neptune and Uranus are often referred to as “Ice Giants.” The
              composition elements, such as water, methane, and ammonia are
              frozen in the outer layers of these planets. In 2014, the first
              “Ice Giant” in our Milky Way was discovered. Along with this,
              Neptunian Planets that are heated up to 2,000 degrees were also
              discovered. This leads to theorization of the formation of
              Neptunian Planets. It may be possible that Neptune and Uranus have
              been transformed into some of the coldest planets in the Solar
              System, but were once warmer.
            </p>
           

            <h2 class="section-heading">Terrestrial Planets</h2>
            <p>
              Planets such as Mars, Venus, and Mercury would be considered
              terrestrial, or rocky, planets. Outside of the Solar System,
              terrestrial planets are between ½ to twice the size of the Earth.
              They are composed of rocks, silicate, and carbon. Terrestrial
              planets are most similar to Super-Earths, the only difference
              being their sizes. Their composition is mainly rock, silicate,
              water, and carbon. A bulk of their composition is iron, and they
              have been found with liquid on their surfaces as well. It is
              estimated that over 10 billion Terrestrial Planets exist in just
              the Milky Way alone! In 2017, one solar system by the name
              Trappist-1, had seven Terrestrial Planets. These planets look the
              most promising when searching for habitability. Most of them have
              been found within the habitable zone of their star. This means
              that they are within the distance range of the star to exhibit a
              temperature similar to that of Earth. Many of them may also have
              more water than Earth because of the amount of water vapor in
              their atmospheres. Scientists hope that with more advanced
              telescopes, these planet’s can be studied more closely.
            </p>
           
            <h2 class="section-heading">Hunt for Exoplanets</h2>
            <p>
              How do we find exoplanets? Although scientists have only searched
              a small area of the cosmic scale, these exoplanets are still
              thousands of light years away from Earth. How is it possible to
              detect planets that far? Well, researchers have five main ways to
              spot them. As mentioned previously, Gas Giants can be so large
              they cause a wobble in space. This can be detected from Earth, and
              is known as radial velocity. This is one of the most common ways
              to find exoplanets. The most common, known as transiting, is when
              a planet passes between its star and the Earth. This causes a
              dimming of the star’s light, allowing scientists to confirm a
              planet’s presence. Over 4,000 exoplanets have been discovered this
              way. Direct imaging is when astronomers take pictures of the
              planets from Earth. They use powerful tools to be able to capture
              the exoplanet in space and avoid the star’s glare. Another method,
              known as gravitational lensing, is one of the most interesting.
              When gravity is present, it can cause bends in how light travels.
              Detecting these bends in lights can confirm that an object of
              mass, an exoplanet, is there. Lastly, one of the least efficient
              methods of exoplanet detection is astrometry. Only two exoplanets
              have been discovered by this method. It is when a star starts to
              wobble in space in relation to other stars nearby. This allows
              scientists to detect the movement of exoplanets orbiting it.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              Although exoplanet research has been ongoing for decades, there
              are still many unknowns about them. These worlds have the chance
              of containing new chemical elements, different explanations for
              planet formation, and possibly life. They have and still continue
              to raise new theories for interstellar objects and their origins.
              Humanity can only hope to continue their advancements in
              astronomical discoveries and study the worlds that reside outside
              of our solar system.

                        <p>Project management is the process of leading the work of a team to achieve all project goals within the given constraints. In the field of Engineering, it is focused on managing all aspects of engineering projects, not just the engineers or engineering work.</p>
                        <p>Developed by the Project Management Institute (PMI), the five phases of project management are as follows:</p>
                        <p>1. Project conception and initiation: The goal of project initiation is to broadly define the project. This process usually begins with a business case or project charter. If research or feasibility testing is necessary, it is done during this phase.</p>
                        <p>2. Project planning: The planning phase is key to successful project management and focuses on developing a roadmap for the team to follow. During the planning phase, project managers should organize their teams, set up collaborative resources, and set goals.</p>
                        <p>It should be noted that all goals set during this stage must be SMART and CLEAR. SMART goals are goals that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Timely while CLEAR goals are goals that are Collaborative, Limited, Emotional, Appreciable and, Refinable.</p>
                        <p>3. Project execution: During the project execution phase, the team develops and completes deliverables. This phase begins with a kick-off meeting, is marked by the onset of status reports and updates, and transitions into performance and monitoring as the project progresses.</p>
                        <p>It progresses as a team is developed, resources are assigned, tracking systems are set up, assigned tasks are executed, status meetings are held, and plans are modified if/as needed.</p>
                        <p>4. Project performance/monitoring: Project performance and monitoring ensures that project results align with the management plan. Project managers use key performance indicators (KPIs) to determine if the project is on track. The most common KPIs are project objectives, quality deliverables, effort and cost tracking, and project performance.</p>
                        <p>5. Project closing: Once a project is complete, the team must formally close it. Project managers hold a post mortem meeting to evaluate successes and failures. Project closing helps a team identify things that went well and areas for improvement.</p>
                        <p>These five steps are put in place in order to successfully complete a project.  It involves identifying and managing risks, smart budgeting, effective communication among teams and stakeholders, careful resource management and much more.</p>
                        <p>Taking careful resource management as a pillar of project management, one can deduce that this involves not only material resources, but also  human resources. Effective project management must cater for all individuals involved in the project, including but not limited to their mental wellness.</p>
                        <p>Project management, although widely acknowledged on paper as an essential skill that all engineers should have, is still quite lacking on-site as it is very common to see engineers battling stress and depression due to having to deal with their workload and its provisions, or lack thereof, for their mental wellness.</p>
                        <p>The findings of a research paper titled “Critical Analysis of Mental Health Research among Construction Project Professionals”state that stress, job burnout, depression, anxiety and substance use disorder (SUD) are prominent forms of mental ill-health among construction project professionals(CPPs).</p>
                        <p>However, many projects lack the measuring scales for evaluating the mental ill-health symptoms. Moreover, generic stressors including long working hours, time pressure, and work overload were used to establish the root causes of mental ill-health.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, effective project management, in this context, seeks to strike a balance between successfully completing the project at hand and maintaining the mental wellness of all construction workers and engineers involved.</p>
                        <p> A project cannot and should not be said to have been managed effectively if the mental health of the workers involved have taken a downward turn as a result of working on the project.</p>

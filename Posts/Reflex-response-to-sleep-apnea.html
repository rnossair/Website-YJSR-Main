                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Sleep Apnea?</h2>
                        <p>Sleep Apnea is one of the most common sleep disorders but it could also be fatal due to the lack of oxygen getting to the brain while your body is the most vulnerable. Lack of oxygen to tissues is better known as hypoxia in the medical world while hypoxemia is known as low oxygen levels in the blood. During episodes of Sleep Apnea, muscles that support the soft tissue in your throat such as your tongue relax and close off your airway preventing normal breathing patterns.</p>
                        <p>To date, there are many treatments and clinical trials in progress studying new and innovative ways to aid the effects on the body and prevent hypoxia/hypoxemia. All the treatments either aim to keep the airway open or prevent relaxation in the muscles. For example, the well-known CPAP machine keeps constant pressurized air high enough to prevent the collapse of the airway. The use of a CPAP machine can run the average person between $250-$1,000. Of course, if covered by insurance and what coverage you do have, it could be less or none at all.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How can you find out if you are suffering from Sleep Apnea?</h2>
                        <p>The most common way to find out if you have sleep apnea professionally is a sleep study which involves many different techniques but the most known is the home sleep test. During the test, your blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, and breathing patterns are monitored through a portable device. While many cases of Sleep Apnea are categorized as obstructive, there are also 2 other types: Central and Complex.</p>
                        <p>Obstructive sleep apnea is caused by an obstruction such as your tongue in the way of your breathing due to muscles relaxing inappropriately. Central sleep apnea is caused by your brain not sending the proper messages to your body causing sleep apnea. Complex sleep apnea is a mix of both, Obstructive and Central, causing less concern because it is typically diagnosed as just Obstructive sleep apnea.</p>
                        <p>If you are truly concerned about developing sleep apnea, your neck may be a valuable clue. For men if your neck is larger than 17 inches wide, this could indicate you may have a narrower airway and more likely for an obstruction to cause sleep apnea. For women if your neck is larger than 15 inches wide, this could indicate again a narrow airway and increases the risk of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is also hereditary and could possibly be given to you if you have a family member who is currently diagnosed. The decrease of oxygen to your brain during episodes of sleep apnea can cause memory fragmentation and daytime drowsiness.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>As you’ve read in this article, there are 3 different types of sleep apnea. The different types have slightly different effects on the body. You are concerned or you have developed any signs of sleep apnea of any kind, please see a healthcare professional.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>It is no wonder that there has been a growing demand for the potential of ‘big data’ to enhance our understanding of a wide array of societal challenges including in the medicine and public health fields. Despite the broad excitement and interest, there is no single agreed definition of big data. However, it is widely accepted that the greater volume, complexity, coverage, and speed of availability of the observations and variables are critical components. Facilitated by advances in computing hardware, software, and networking, big data has been heralded as a powerful new resource that can provide novel insights into human behavior and social phenomena.</p>
                        <p>As we know, childhood obesity is a serious health epidemic. According to statistics from the World Obesity Federation, there are around 200 million obese children around the world. Data from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health highlights that 1 in every 5 young children is overweight or obese once they leave primary school.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Literature Review and Case Study</h2>
                        <p>In the field of obesity research, there is a long history of using routine data sources to track the prevalence of hormonal and heart diseases. Moreover, it has proven to be useful when it comes to identifying risk factors associated with high BMI like hypothyroidism, emphasizing its potential to broaden our understanding of obesity. “Big data” allows scientists to bring together information from different facets of the environment and behaviors.</p>
                        <p>Professors working in the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark at the National Health Service (NHS) have demonstrated how data analytics might help improve obesity rates. The organization says that it can target resources, identify partnerships, and uncover relationships between health issues, people and place, and reach wider audiences through leveraging geographic and people data.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The key to these discoveries is the Tableau Analytics platform</h2>
                        <p>In the Tableau Analytics platform, complex regression models are used instead of traditional data visualization tools, like Excel, to disseminate health data and accurately interpret scatter or geospatial points.</p>
                        <p>The analysts have observed a significant variation in childhood obesity and its underlying factors such as income and deprivation across the two boroughs. This observation is only accessible by the quick and easy exploration and mapping of big data that led to immediate insights.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, the scientists have been able to anticipate the trends in which the obesity rates are rising by locating the epicenter of disorders related to obesity i.e. from west to east in England. <br>Voila! An amazing interaction through the mapping of data has been observed!</p>
                        <p>Apart from Tableau analytics, technologies like Alteryx, Mapbox, and Salesforce have further broadened the scientists’ capabilities by allowing them to overlay what they know about the health issues and data, where they are anticipating answers to questions like where, why, and how the obesity levels are fluctuating along with their consequences, where their projects are taking place, and where their resources are following.</p>
                        <p>This has brought another astonishing point. Tableau	 in collaboration with other data science segments can give answers to the above questions in just 20 minutes provided that the latest in-built apps and hyper files are being used in research. The effects of gathering data at this pace have led to efficient allocation and utilization of resources in a given period with a greater extent of precision and accuracy which couldn't be achieved with the previous models of software.</p>
                        <p>Rob Parker, the head of data and analytics for Guy’s and St Thomas’ Charity, says, “This ability to connect and collaborate in the interactive maps is generating valuable, transparent intelligence into childhood obesity. Tableau has enabled scientists like us to uncover new insights into childhood obesity across the boroughs. For example, if you take the top 12 wards with the highest rates of childhood obesity and map them, it’s immediately apparent that those wards are right next to each other.” The generated reports are significantly used by doctors in the UK and USA to prescribe more viable medical treatments and effective policy decisions to their patients. Thus, Tableau is proving its essentiality in the medical world through its in-depth analysis catering to the needs of the respective organizations and its support for various data sources like Oracle, MySQL, etc.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How can evolving data analytics lead to a reduction in obesity rates?</h2>
                        <p>The aggregation of the regression models and the third-party tools enables medical institutes to expand and better target health programs. The integration of the Charity’s Salesforce application with Tableau is helping to allocate the resources and budget efficiently when it comes to identifying cures for obesity, one of the biggest challenges that researchers encounter while using big data and technology in healthcare.</p>
                        <p>
                            This discovery has been adopted by many other regions and countries to gain insights into obesity risk factors and behavioral characteristics of the 21st century. According to the latest report from World Obesity Federation (WOF), Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) show significant use of six categories of data for research on identifying the root of high Body Mass Index (BMI) and its implications:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Retail Sales</li>
                                <li>Transport</li>
                                <li>Geospatial</li>
                                <li>Commercial Weight Management</li>
                                <li>Social media</li>
                                <li>Smartphones and wearable technologies</li>
                            </ol>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Retail sales data is used to monitor nutrient or food intakes at a population level, ascertain national or regional nutrient availability, compare ‘vice’ purchases online versus in-store, or evaluate the impact of policies or interventions (e.g. changes to benefits (food stamps), nutrition labeling, taxation or public health campaigns)</li>
                                <li>Transport monitoring uses traffic flow data from public roadways in the United States to investigate the ecological association between areas with greater motorized transport usage (vehicle miles of travel) and obesity prevalence.</li>
                                <li>Commercial data provide the opportunity for independent real-world service evaluations in programs like Weight Watchers, NHS Referral Service, D2C Internet weight-loss program, and HENRY to observe nutritional levels.</li>
                                <li>Geospatial data is used to measure different features of the built and natural environment such as fast food outlets through maps that develop audits and surveys to observe obesity trends.</li>
                                <li>Social media data from Twitter and Facebook on posts, shares, interests, and follows are used as proxies for behaviors and perceptions surrounding obesity creating awareness in children through discussions on weight loss and using this data to explore physical activity behaviors.</li>
                                <li>In-built apps on smartphones and wearable bands are used to describe physical activity outcomes, such as step counts, GPS movements, or logged journeys. Apps such as LeapBand, Smash Your Food, Super Stretch Yoga, and the Human Body App have been preferred by parents for their precision to keep their children’s obesity under control and inculcate healthy eating.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Big data is rapidly changing the way scientists carry out research on medical issues. All these innovations have proved their impressive results on young children by making them conscious of their fitness and calorie-intake levels, eventually leading to a more productive daily routine. This contributes to the fact that business intelligence tools can suggest the after-effects of the specific trend observed in a particular location and also provide regional solutions to regulate weight gain. What more do we need… we can conclude that data science is an essential tool in fighting the childhood obesity epidemic.</p>
                        <p>Although the world of data science is changing the way we carry out research into health and medicine, it’s crucial to identify that ‘big data’ is an under-utilized source of information, and many of its opportunities have yet to be explored as new innovations in big data science are pushed out. The global issue of obesity remains persistent in many countries, and the key to eliminating this problem is by efficiently increasing the prevalence of current technologies and taking advantage of more precise and cost-friendly advances in the upcoming segments of what we call: BIG DATA ANALYTICS.</p>

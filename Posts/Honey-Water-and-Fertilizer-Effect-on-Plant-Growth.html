                        <h2 class="section-heading">SUMMARY</h2>
                        
                        <p>When people garden their plants, they may wonder what the best possible way there is to ensure plant growth. This lab shows the effects of using water, fertilizer, and honey on various plants of the same species to determine which is most and least effective when managing plant growth. The hypothesis states that the NPK fertilizer will serve as the most efficient growth stimulator, is supported by the data. </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">INTRODUCTION</h2>
                        <p>This experiment aims to test the impact NPK fertilizer and honey will have on plant growth in direct contrast to a water control. The fertilizer contains three elements vital in plant growth- nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen is present in chlorophyll, the compound allowing sunlight to be used in light-dependent reactions (Heard). It also is a component of DNA necessary for duplication. Additionally, phosphate is a main portion of ATP that supplies the cell with energy to continue its metabolic processes and another contributor to DNA (Sawyer). Lastly, potassium is associated with osmosis and the movement of nutrients as well as carbohydrates through plant tissue (Kaiser). <br><br>
                        Seeing as NPK includes all of these elements, it will allow photosynthesis to carry on. Since the distilled honey solution also consists of phosphorus and potassium, it will serve as a beneficial attribute too. The conclusion will outline the specific connection between photosynthesis producing ATP and another aspect of the cell- mitosis. This allows for two identical daughter somatic cells to grow and divide, permitting the growth measured throughout the course of the experiment. This lab ultimately aims to demonstrate that the fertilizer is the best promoter of the cell cycle and photosynthesis, followed by honey. <br><br>
                        The hypothesis states that the NPK fertilizer will serve as the most efficient growth stimulator, followed by honey as they contain the vital elements listed above.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">RESULTS</h2>
                        <p>There is a significant trend in data bars not overlapping. Namely, the 2 standard error of the mean calculations between water and fertilizer do not overlap (Figure 2), the 2 standard error of the mean calculations between water and honey do not overlap (Figure 2), and the 2 standard error of the mean calculations between honey and fertilizer do not overlap (Figure 2). Moreover, With fertilizer, the plant grew to an average of 24.6 cm, reaching a peak of 32 cm. On the other hand, with water, the plant only grew to an average of 19.8 cm, reaching a peak of 20 cm (Figure 1). While the water grew at a rate of -0.5, the fertilizer had a growth rate of 6 (Figure 3), the honey has a rate of 3.4, greater than the -0.5 the sole water produced (Figure 3). At the end of Week 4, the control plant height was 19.5 cm, the fertilizer plant height was 32 cm, and the honey plant height was 14.5 cm (Figure 1). </p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">DISCUSSION</h2>
                        <p>As represented in the data, the 2 standard error of the mean calculations between water and fertilizer do not overlap, indicating that there’s significant variation between data sets, rejecting the null that there is no difference in results between the two (Figure 2). With fertilizer, the plant grew to an average of 24.6 cm, reaching a peak of 32 cm. On the other hand, with water, the plant only grew to an average of 19.8 cm, reaching a peak of 20 cm (Figure 1). It is vital to recognize water influenced a horizontal growth pattern. While the water grew at a rate of -0.5, the fertilizer had a growth rate of 6 (Figure 3). Therefore, the fertilizer also caused 12 times more overall growth in the plant than the water. Using photosynthesis, plants capture sunlight with the help of chlorophyll in the leaf cells, absorb water through its roots as it travels against gravity up the xylem tubes, and takes in carbon dioxide through tiny pores known as the stomata. These serve as reactants. Within this process, there are a set of light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membrane when sunlight is present, converting it into chemical energy. To simplify the complex process, water is split to provide hydrogen ions and electrons, simultaneously producing oxygen. These electrons and protons contribute to the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH and the synthesis of ATP. Light energy is trapped by Photo System II, increasing the energy level of electrons involved as they travel through the electron transport chain to Photo System I. This establishes a gradient that transfers H+ ions to the lumen, where it travels through ATP synthase to add a phosphate group to ADP. The produced molecules, ATP and NADPH, store energy and carry electrons. They also serve as reactants for the next phase of photosynthesis, light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin Cycle. An enzyme known as Rubisco located in the stroma contains the five-carbon RubP and a CO2 molecule. The catalyzation results in two three-carbon molecules- a section referred to as carbon fixation. ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions provide a hydrogen atom, resulting in two of the simple sugar G3P that are used to make one glucose molecule. 12 total molecules of G3P are generated from the six carbon dioxide molecules contributed at a time, yet four of them are recycled back into RubP to allow the cycle to continue. <br><br>Outlining this process depicts the complex way plants make their own food, or ATP energy, that can promote the successful completion of metabolic processes such as those ensuing in the cell’s powerhouse- the mitochondria. Namely, it allows cellular division to ensue through the process of mitosis. For example, ATP is vital for the APC/C checkpoint in anaphase and the S part of interphase. Mitosis follows interphase, made up of G1 (cell growth), S (synthesis, or the replication of DNA), and G2 (preparation to divide). The first step of mitosis itself is prophase, where the chromatin condense into chromosomes, the mitotic spindle forms, centrosomes move to opposite poles, and nucleolus disappears. Prometaphase follows, where the nuclear envelope disassembles, and chromosomes form 2 kinetochores at the centromere. The chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate, or meet in the middle, during metaphase. They physically separate into the cell’s respective ends at anaphase. Finally, telophase consists of cell elongation, the unfolding of the chromosomes into chromatic, and daughter nuclei forming on each side. Full division occurs in the cytokinesis step, where a cleavage furrow begins to form. The result of this process are two genetically identical daughter somatic cells. The process allows for a body to continue to regrow and/or replace any impaired areas. <br><br>The addition of water to its own pot serves as a control as water is vital in allowing photosynthesis to ensue; however, the two tested variables are set to hinder or amplify the cell cycle that promotes this growth via division into daughter somatic cells. Not only do the standard error of the mean bars strongly suggest the most efficient option, the chi square can add to this data. The plant’s ability to grow leaves is a valuable annotation to review considering the leaves consist of the stomata that allow for carbon dioxide and oxygen to travel through. With a critical value of 0.33 at a 95% confidence level and three degrees of freedom, the 6.7 chi square value of water contradicts the null. This means that there was significant variation between the number of leaves in each week- indicating a health decline. This does not mean the water inhibited growth because it did grow throughout the experiment as assessed in the line graph, but because leaf presence decreased throughout the trial, it means that its health suffered no major aid apart from a normal plant recorded at any time. Leaves were lost because they were dried up, so future trials should simply include more water. Under the same circumstances, the chi square value of 0.9 for the fertilizer, accompanied by the fact that leaves increased over time, means that the null was rejected, and the fertilizer allowed for a large increase in leaf synthesis. This could allow for more stomata usage and thus more photosynthesis, allowing for the energy to permit the cell cycle to continue. Similarly, the 2.8 chi square value is larger than the critical value for the honey, and since the leaf amount increased throughout the weeks, the null that there is no significant growth between weeks is rejected, indicating the honey was effective in promoting stomata presence and enabling photosynthesis to create energy to drive the cell cycle. The fertilizer contains three main ingredients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Nitrogen allows for photosynthesis to carry on successfully because it is a large part of chlorophyll, the compound allowing sunlight to be used in light-dependent reactions. On a molecular level, nitrogen is a major building block of life because it is a major part of amino acids that create nucleic acids and thus DNA. The more nitrogen, the more DNA that can be replicated in the S portion of interphase. Amino acids are also the building blocks of proteins. Additionally, phosphorus is similar of nitrogen in that it is required for DNA, so its presence permits the S part of interphase to continue. It also helps the body make ATP as it is in the NADPH throughout the photosynthetic process described above, meaning that it helps the cell have energy to undergo processes such as the outlined cell cycle. There are three phosphate groups, dependent on phosphorus, in ATP, and the breaking of a phosphate group is what actually allows the ATP to expel its energy. Lastly, potassium is involved in cell elongation and expansion, a vital need for telophase. The K+ uptake through specific channels is essential for adequate cell cycle progression. It is used in a process known as “cytoplasmic alkalization” or reduction of high acidic levels to achieve homeostasis and satisfy conditions for mitosis. It is also associated with osmosis, as well as the movement of nutrients and carbohydrates in plant tissue. Within plants, it also aids enzyme activate needed for ATP production. <br><br>These three ingredients stand for the NPK in the NPK fertilizer, thus explaining how it allows for the best plant growth. Honey contains phosphorus and potassium as well, two of the main three. So, it helps plant growth, but to a limited extent that ultimately cannot compare to the fertilizer. The rates are displayed in the slopes of growth analyzed above, but it is important to recognize that the honey has a rate of 3.4, greater than the -0.5 the sole water produced, meaning its addition is more beneficial to the plant than just the control (Figure 3). In sum, as outlined vigorously above, the null is rejected while the alternative hypothesis is accepted, as conveyed in the graphs and chi square value calculations.</p>

                        <p><i>Materials:</i></p>
                        
                        <p>Materials required to conduct this experiment include 3 geraniums, soil, pots, 2 tablespoons of honey, water (400 ml), NPK Fertilizer (200 ml), and 3 beakers. The specific ways the are implemented into the experiment are outlined below. </p>
                        
                        <p><i>Methods:</i></p>
                        
                        <p>One should add a geranium and soil to three pots. 200 ml of water and NPK fertilizer should be added to their respective pots. Next, boil 1 cup of water and add two tablespoons of honey. Allow to cool before placing 200 ml in its pot. Label the three pots with their individual variable. Once a week for four weeks repeat these steps, adding 200 ml of each substance into the plant until damp. Set in the sun and trim off dead flowers and/or leaves. Throughout the weeks, take pictures of the plants to document growth and flowering progress. Count the leaves each week and measure the heights. Performing the lab, additional water, fertilizer, and distilled honey solution was added, so the soil was damp. </p>

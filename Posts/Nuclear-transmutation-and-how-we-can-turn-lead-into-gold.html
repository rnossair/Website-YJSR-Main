                        <h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Ever wished you could make gold from lead? This has been the goal of alchemists for hundreds of years. They were on a quest to make the philosopher's stone, a mythical substance that could supposedly perform chrysopoeia (make gold from base metals), cure diseases, prolong human life and make us immortal. Since alchemy was based on a misunderstanding of basic chemistry and physics, alchemists believed in the assumption that the world and everything in it was composed of four basic elements (air, earth, fire, and water). It was also believed that lead was an ‘impure’ form of gold. In order to purify lead, alchemists tried a lot of bizarre recipes, some of which required urine and bones.</p>
                        <p>As we progressed over time and discovered the world of atoms and molecules, we finally found a way to transmute elements. Even if immortality is still out of reach, with the help of modern scientific knowledge and equipment, we have finally made the alchemist’s dream come true.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Transmutation of Elements</h2>
                        <p>In theory, transmuting elements seems pretty easy. Elements are defined by the no. of protons present in their atoms which is their atomic number, if we remove 3 protons from an atom of lead (Atomic no. 82), we will get an atom of gold (Atomic no. 79). This process needs to be repeated a few billion times until we could collect at least a feasible amount of gold. However, this process is easier said than done. It is very difficult to remove protons from atoms as the forces that hold the nuclei together are very strong.</p>
                        <p>In 1901, scientists Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford observed that some thorium laying in their lab had become radioactive and had changed into radium through radioactive decay. This was the first time we had experienced actual transmutation. Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy through radiation. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay, all of which involve emitting one or more particles. The thorium had undergone radioactive decay where it emitted a few protons and turned to radium. Most elements after Bismuth in the periodic table are radioactive.</p>
                        <p>Radioactive decay is an effective way of transmutation but it isn’t a great way to produce gold. This is because radioactive elements take months, if not years or millennia, to decay into more common elements. Not to mention radioactive emissions can also cause certain illnesses like cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Also, the fact that lead is a stable element and doesn’t decay any further makes direct transmutation of gold from lead via radioactive decay nearly impossible.</p>
                        <p>Another way to transmute gold is by applying large electric currents to mercury. One such experiment was performed by Japanese physicist Hanyaro Nagako, whose team succeeded in making gold from mercury (Atomic no. 80). They applied large amounts of electricity to mercury to rip the protons off forcing it to turn into gold. Later, however, researchers who performed such experiments achieved negative results, throwing these findings into controversy.</p>
                        <p>This brings us to the transmutation of elements by bombarding their atoms with various particles through nuclear accelerators. With this process, some of the protons from the bombarding particles are lodged in the target nucleus, promoting its transmutation into a different element although the conditions are not fully controllable.</p>
                        <p>In other cases, bombarding atoms with neutrons can make them heavy and unstable causing the atom to undergo radioactive decay.  Example: bombardment of Platinum-198 with a neutron creates an unstable isotope of platinum that undergoes beta decay to Gold-199.</p>
                        <p>It is relatively straightforward to convert lead, bismuth, platinum, or mercury into gold through these sorts of nuclear reactions.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Certain Problems that are Faced</h2>
                        <p>As they say, “Nothing in life comes problem-free”, this gold making too had its own set of problems.</p>
                        <p>It is quite obvious by now that making gold through such methods would never make a profit but rather drown us in debt. Any gold that is found after such experiments is in trace amounts of less than 1 mg. The money required to run such nuclear accelerators greatly surpasses the market value of gold. The whole process is quite inefficient and a lot of energy is required to induce transmutation while the amount of gold produced is quite minuscule. Not to forget most of the gold atoms formed are unstable and radioactive isotopes of the regular gold and after a few days decay back to other elements. This makes sense since the main goal of these experiments wasn’t to get rich by making gold but to learn more about the nature and behavior of subatomic particles.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Our centuries-old wish of converting lead into gold at will has finally been fulfilled even if it may never be possible to transmute lead into gold without having to deal with its subsequent problems.</p>
                        <p>Looking back, it would still be considered more practical to obtain gold from lead ores instead. The minerals Galena (Lead sulfide), Cerussite (Lead carbonate), and Anglesite (Lead sulfate) often contain Zinc, Gold, Silver, and other metals. Once the ore has been pulverized, chemical techniques are sufficient to separate the gold from the lead. While it wouldn’t be considered transmutation, the result is almost alchemy.</p>
